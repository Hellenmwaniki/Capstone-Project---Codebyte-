Well done team Kenya❤,
"This channel is racist! Report the channel, it edited the video to favor the white and not show the Kenyans receiving the medal 🥇",
"Congs Kenya, lots of love from Uganda",
"Just WOW Kenya, what a run, what a stamina!",
I'm a south African love kenyans,
"Why are the most famous women in the world always reduced to performing in their underwear? Its ridiculous, unnecessary sexual objectification, just stop it.",
Nice,

We compete with time Kenyans 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,
Algorithm finally did something right,
They even rounded the last athlete,
It's shows how weak and how lousy U.S.A. and Australian athletes...Kenyans are black diamonds pearl very good disciplines athletes..well done KENYANS.,
"Very shameful of world athletics committee to be controlled by Whites from announcers to the stage controllers highlighting the pace of the Australians over the winning champions who were demonstrably in a league of their own in obliteraterating the records in the event.  Faith Kipyegoni,Obiri and Chirono, despite challenge by the Ethiopian women in middle distance running, continue to dominate the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Diamond League over the same distance to date. Very little was showered on this epic journey for the Africans at this event, except for the likes of Steve Ovettts' of the world begrudgingly acknowledging the marvel of central African women's dominace. It's a shame!!",
Those Kenyan girls made that run look effortless. Absolute poetry in motion. Unbelievable. Congratulations from Canada.,
"Kenyans are custom made by God, keep chasing them you will never catch them",

Watu wa kasongo hoyeee.,
Par Excellence Akways. You go Kenyan women 🎉🎉🎉,Always
That was exciting to watch and the Kenyan girls wow!....that was incredible!,
The American trainers told their runners to run like robots: staying upright with rigid formulaic arm movement instead of leaning into the stride and letting arms swing as should naturally happen.  They spend more energy springing upward than forward.,
Фантастика,
"Super congratulations but who made the video looks like they are haters why they didn't show them getting their praises and they props it just goes to show you these people mentality towards the Black race, Big up my peoples.",

"If I'm reading correctly, the Kenyans went 13:40.40 for the 5000m, a full thirty seconds under the women's individual world record at the time (Tirunesh Dibaba at 14:11.15 in 2008), and about 18 seconds under the newly set WR (Beatrice Chebet at 13:58.06 on July 5, 2025).  The Americans, in second place, were under what the individual WR was at the time, but I don't believe they were under Chebet's time.  Amazing progression.",
The end of this video is very disappointing..... 😢😢😢😢,
What do they eat in Kenya for them to run fast like this,
🎉🎉🎉 Kenya🇰🇪♥️♥️♥️,
Congratulations team Kenya. Africa is proud of you,
🎉😂😊,

"I can't help but notice childish racists and nationalists are showing up in full force, celebrating their particular race and nationality  instead of individual achievement.  Here's a hint.  If a person from a particular country and of a particular race wins a track meet, honor should go to the athlete who put in the work, not the race or nation from which she or he originates.   Grow up y'all.",
"Viva👍👍🥳🥳🥳🥳 to the Kenyan gals congratulations.we see how you smash the long distance races,  and we celebrate you 📢",

"Another clickbait misleading headline. This isn't the fastest relay ever (as of this video posting), it was the fastest at the time it was run eleven years ago. Also, the 90+ Legends announcer at 18:37 incorrectly identified the race as a 4 X 1600 meters. It's actually 4 X 1500 meters.",

Not good if your running with your mouth open.
I used to run at school through the woods for 20 minutes
And  aslo Saturday used to run from my mother house.
up to the park and down the road.And sprint finish.
As well as competing with other schools after school.
I still run to the bus stop in the morning and from the other bus stop to work.
Also have running shoes.

where are the kenyans on tge podium?,"yeah, the ending of this vid was really weird!!!  Like there was no real podium and wha?  It was just strange."
Despite 45 I still wished USA could take the silver medal. It’s good that news media refused to show when Australia overtaking USA. Very painful indeed. Kenya breaking the World Record and not even showing the athletes on the podium receiving their medals was just a low blow beneath the belt. That’s more shameful than just pure racism for the western news media coverage. Not surprising but shameful!,

"What is this fetish with saying ""two times"" instead of ""twice""??  IE, ""2 time junior"" cross country champion 6:20; which is not as mellow to the ear, as the simple ""twice Junior"" cross country champion!  A bit like the old fashioned way of  how we used to ""contact"" someone, until the americans felt the need ""to reach out""?  You do that when someone is about to fall?  Is this needless extension of the old fashioned english that necessary?","Agreed.  I still use the word ""thrice""... just to wobble folks and make them think.  
The other one that has fallen is how we used to be taught to say ""(so and so) and I"",  which was a selfless way of talking, now, we say ""me and (so and so)""  which is the selfish way of talking.....
English and all its stupidnesses."

Fastest Relay Ever? Watch This Epic Race and witness pure speed and teamwork like never before!,
"On one hand yes this is impressive. On the other hand it was also predictable who was going to win this race. I am someone who does not keep up to date in the world of relay races, but I have watched a fair amount of men’s and women’s relay races. It is no longer a mystery of who will win these races. The reality is that people from Africa, Kenya, and Jamaica have the natural physical attributes built into their DNA to be the fastest runners. 

Anyone from any other nationality is at a severe disadvantage. It lessens the accomplishment of anyone winning at anything if they have all the advantages to give them the win. Especially if those advantages are something they are born with.",
All we know is that United Africa beat the other 3 aliens… end of discussion,

Marathons are often won by Kenyans. 
Proud to call Kenya my (adopted) home.","@@evelynewanja7503 if you say so... Report: women's 4x1500m – Bahamas 2014

""Kenya’s women’s 4x1500m quartet improved the world record* by more than half a minute to 16:33.58 at the IAAF World Relays in Nassau, The Bahamas, on Saturday (25).

The team of Mercy Cherono, Faith Kipyegon, Irene Jelagat and Hellen Obiri not only took the first prize of US$50,000 but also a world record bonus of US$50,00.

Cherono opened with a leg of 4:07.4, leading at the handover, Kipyegon followed with 4:08.5, Jalegat ran a leg of 4:10.8 with Obiri bringing Kenya home with 4:06.9 (all splits unofficial).

The previous world best of 17:05.72 was set by another Kenyan team in Nairobi last month.

Cherono, the Moscow 2013 5000m silver medallist,  made no effort to start the 4x1500m as aggressively as the Kenyan men had gone after the 4x800m record earlier in the day, and Australia’s Zoe Buckman was able to stay close during the first leg. 

Just after Buckman handed off to Bridey Delaney, however, the USA’s Kate Mackey took the baton from Heather Kampf and ran straight into the Australian lead off runner, with both tumbling to the track. 

Mackey scrambled back to her feet but then faced a gap up to the pair in front of her.

Faith Kipyegon disposed of the Australian threat quite thoroughly in the second leg, opening up an 80-metre gap on Delaney, making her move from 500 metres onwards, before handing off to Jelegat. 

In the third leg, in which Jelegat was running on her own, Kate Grace was able to close the remaining gap between the USA and Australia's Brittany McGowan and overtook the Antipodean to put the USA into second place.

Jelegat slowed a little over the last 400m of her stint, but when she handed off to Hellen Obiri, the record was clearly going to be decimated baring disaster but the latter took off like she was only running 800m, clearing the first lap in just 60 seconds. 

Obiri also benefited from the appearance of the Romanian anchor in front of her, a target to chase, and she lapped the Romanian on her final circuit before leading home the first team to run under 17 minutes for the event.

The US women also came in under the old best at 16:55.33, and Australia's 17:08.65 for third was in shouting distance and an Area record. 

Romania, lapped and trailing in fourth, still set another national record with their 17:51.48.""

Go Aussie png with you,
i was very proud of my australian girls .. they held on to make the silver.. excellent job .. and congrats to kenya,"I'm afraid they did not, I've looked it up and the female voice narator at the end has it slightly wrong, in reality the United States won silver and the Australian team won bronze."
Where are my South Africans??,

WTH with the music at 16:24 ? ! ?,Right
"I am an Indian and seeing the winner, I wept as I supported wholeheartedly a non American and non white team.
God BLACK people have brought glory to many countries, but not to their own native countries.
I as a humble person from BHARAT- that is INDIA, want the glories come from the native people of African nations and not American or English or for that fact European colonizers' flags, who have deceived you and all colours since centuries.",
🎉🎉🎉 congratulations my people always win 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪,
"Unbelievable stuff, heck of a race, congratulations to Kenya. One problem, they showed the USA comfortable over Australia and them crossing the finish line in second, then said Australia got the silver and USA got the Bronze. ????","Nah, USA got silver, 13 seconds ahead of the Aussies.  What was shown kinda confirms that, as the Aussie's came out first, for the presentaion, which would make sense if they finished third.  Despite the US being 22 seconds behind Kenya, they were still under the previous world record time, which shows what an amazing run the Kenyan's performed that day."
Wow!,
I hope there werent any men running in that relay. A lot of sickos mutilate their genitalia just so they can cheat and compete in women's sports.,
"Typical US athletes, big egos with litlle to show for it. Their president is prime example. Even the Australian over took them.",Sounds like you got deported. 
16:33.58 Dang if they ain't some bad WOMEN RUNNING.LAP'N THE 4TH PLACE TEAM WHILE DOING SO. I'D FALLIN AFTER FIRST LAP.LOL BUT BACK N THE DAYS I'D BEEN LUCKY TO RUN A 7 MINUTE MILE. BREATH TAKING NEVER THE LESS &A BIG CONGRATS TO KENYA &WE KNOW THAT COUNTRY PRETTY MUCH DOMINATES THE LONG RUNNING.,
ケニヤ人の女性選手はカレンジンのようだ、彼女達は毎朝学校に走って通っている、しかも彼女たちの生まれた土地は２０００Mの高地あり、幼いころから毎朝高地トレイニングしている様なもの、普通の人では対抗できない。,"Yes, extraordinary people."
ケニヤ人は誕生した時から過酷な人生競争が始まっている、彼らの母親は１０程度子供を産むが、最後に残るのは３名ほどだち言う。生き残った彼らは人生の勝者です。,
"Great cause to celebrate these Kenyan lady runners, but why does this clip not end with the winners atop the podium????  What a slight!","America is too ashamed to bear the humiliation. Like it or not, Africans are your bosses!"
spectacular! congrats to all.,
"Fantastic race,,queens,Kenya rules, from Canada.",
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do,
"Fabulous, & for this occasional fan, please write the year and date in your written material! Thanks!",
"Good on them 
So glad to see this 🎉🎉🎉",
And it’s actually women in a women’s race….unbelievable.,
Kampf  German  name meaning fight.,
not worth watching as whin you use trans women in place of real women to most of the world id not going to watch as it id still cheating,
Ooh ooh,
easy when you replace a real woman with a man,
The winners are Nephilim descendants from demons. See Genesis 6.,

"USA finished in 2nd in this race, not 3rd.  Their time of 16:55.33 is ranked number 5 all time as of today.","I thought so, too."

"USA finished in 2nd in this race, not 3rd.  Their time of 16:55.33 is ranked number 5 all time as of today.",I was wondering why they say Australia Silver. It looks like a mistake
"USA finished in 2nd in this race, not 3rd.  Their time of 16:55.33 is ranked number 5 all time as of today.",​@@African215 this race was in 2014 🎉🎉🎉
This is from 2014.  USA now has the world record at 16:27.02,
"4 Kenyan cousins, hi cousins",
Prolly a dude. 😂,
"What's the point of presenting a race that isn't part of the Olympic Games?
Aside from being long and boring, this race dates back to 2014!",
To be fair all 4 are biolgical males,
It was not a serious event. And of course not an official event of IAAFJust for fun and show.Relays with ONLY 4 competitors teams? TO be serious has to be announced long time ago and to participate minimum 16 national teams with semifinals and etc.,
The music nearly ruined watching this record race.,I agree!  Too much of a distraction!
Wow - Kenya absoluately CRUSHING it here!  Much respect.,
"Look at those beautiful long strides by all the runners.

"I just don't understand, When exactly it happened?  At least what year?  And why at the end you show on podium Australian, but not Kenian?  Did Australian won the rase?  Love the race, don't like cropped video.",
"I don't cast any dispersion over the greatness of this event.  Such accomplished runners!  What an achievement!!
  BUT
_This race_ was run in 2014, 11 years ago.  

The next team to break the record was in 2020 with a time of 16: 27. 02 , a women's track club from Portland.

""90+Legends"" channel is *_repackaging old stuff._*   They show track and field history since 1999, hence ""Legends.""  However, they don't make that very clear. 
Apparently ""90+Legends"" saw an opportunity.

To be fair, this 2014 event was introduced in the past tense.  But the way it was set up made it seem like it was within the last few days, not _more than a decade._

The channel should have announced it as a 2014 event , with a bumper meme, right _at the beginning._",
🎉I love Kenya 🇰🇪,
Congratulations to the Kenyan princesses!!! I thought the USA was in 2nd place with a substantial lead. Dud they end up getting caught by Australia...???,
Congratulations to our queens..,
Pongezi as usual you make u proud,
"Excuse me!!!.  You've pictured the 2nd place winners on the podium, BUT NOT the team that broke the record and came in first!   Wtaf!!!!!",They can’t just give credit where credit is due.
Well done Queens of Kenya 😊❤❤❤,
Kenya 🇰🇪 women won with record breaking performance but you ended your video with team placing third?????? I Would definitely NOT subscribe to this channel.,

"""fearless""??  What in-the-world does fear have to do with running in a sports event (I've been there as a competitor, so don't trifle with me)??   Fear of losing?  Any competitor that is experiencing fear is in need of psychiatric assistance.   At this level of competition fear is the last thing that encumbers a competent athlete.  *Good video, but the WOKE hype is getting old.*",

"Awww @18:45 you blew it.  Australia got bronze,.  The video shows USA finishing in second just a few moments before you misspoke.  The record was set earlier in the year, beating the 5 year old record of the University of Tennessee by .17.  17:08.17 was the target.  Australia in third barely missed the existing world record, 17:08.65,  USA was almost 13 seconds faster that the record when they stepped on the track.  16:55.33  Of Course Kenya was almost 35 seconds better at 16:33.58",

@Ergopho - The Kenyans did break the Women’s World Record what are you talking about!?,
"Wow, what an incredible display of speed and strategy! 🌟 The way these athletes pushed each other to the limit was nothing short of inspiring. Can't believe how close they were to breaking the world record! 🏃‍♀💨 Who else was on the edge of their seat during those changeovers? 🙌","The Kenyans did break the world record at the time but that was later broken by a US team, in 2020 I think and that is still the current world record."

"Did the commentator not watch the race?  How could Australia win silver when they came in third, well behind the American team?",
"Warembo wa Kenya wamelazimisha watangazaji kutaja majina ya asili ya Kenya kwa usahihi bila hiyari kwa sababu ya kazi bora sana ambayo wakimbiaji wa Kenya wamekuwa wakifanya huko duniani.
Nilikuwa nasikia tu Kipyegon, Obiri.....
Hatari sana wawakilishi wetu toka kenya. Nimetokwa machozi ya excitement kuona nidhamu ya hawa warembo, ya kukimbia peke yakobkwa pace ya kasi kama walivyofanya.
NIMEPENDEZEWA SANA.","Mimi nimefurahi hadi nimetokwa na machozi ya furaha yakajaza galoni moja... Wee acha tu; usipime... Hiyo mioto 🔥🔥🔥🔥ya mbiyo za hawa ndugu zetu si ya dunia hii...bali ni ya kule juu mawinguni. Wakati wazungu walikuwa wakikimbia uwanjani, Wakenya (Waafrika) tulikuwa tunakimbia ANGANI/ MAWINGUNI😂😂😂 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Mungu Endelea kuibariki Afrika Mashariki na Afrika yote!"
