1,"Apple missed the boat on AI OR... Apple is doing what it always does, waiting for others to prove a new technology, then ride in on their massive platform and take over. Time will tell which statement is true."
2,"Who added the background music to the video its so fucking distracting. It sounds like nier automata bgm, that makes it impossible to focus"
3,16:26  FEMI KUTI !!! RAAHHH !!!
4,"The greatest AI scam in history, is AI."
5,"if I only knew Siri is a mess, I would bought iP 16 PM in the 1st place. thought switiching from Xiaomi to iP would be better. turns out itâ€™s the opposite."
6,Maybe AI is just a fad like cryptos.
7,Steve Jobs would have made a new iPhone that truly utilizes AI.
8,"Hey man. I'd like to present you a subject that I am very anxious about. Why can't we remove our phone batteries now? This is not only about right to repair but rather right to self privacy. I know our phones track us all day and every hour. This is utterly unacceptable. Even If I turn my phone off I can see where it is on my device. That is alright if the device is stolen but my iphone 15 pro max was stolen and my government (TÃ¼rkiye) did absolutely nothing so far so fk that. I want real true privacy, I want to be able to remove my battery when I go to bed. Why all these mega tech companies pushing us glue? I want the old existing click design, a back cover and a removable battery, not only for the right to repair but for my very own privacy. Otherwise eventually these tech giants will listen to everything we do, and perhaps they'll have magnetic sensors that read magnetic fields to even read our minds, this is not crazy, it is reality and it may already be happenning. I just want to be easily remove the battery of the fking phone I own. Is that too much? If you think so, you're doomed."
9,"They try to cover up their incompetence with liquid glass mess lol ðŸ¤£Apple is dead and soon youtube will be be filled with videos of ""Rise and downfall of Apple"" or ""Apple declared bankruptcy"""
10,the first shoe.
11,"All this really screams Steve Jobs was the Apple we loved. Every time he leaves, the company becomes an IBM."
12,Apple is a design company
13,Chat GPT sucks too... I just decided to cancel my subscription this mth. Gemini is much better with language tasks for now.
14,Steve Jobs would have done very differently. Jony Ive and Scott Forstall would stay.
15,Ai ðŸ˜®apple intelligence ðŸ˜‚
16,"Damn, Apple really pulled an Anthem with this."
17,"I think Billy, apples head of design, needs to be let go."
18,World of A.I Is filled with a bunch of deepfakes
19,Repeat after me- iPhones are value for money only when you buy  a device from three generations before
20,good
21,Dagogo is a king
22,Apple has been making lackluster copy and paste products for the last 10 years straight! Hopefully their dominance is coming to an end bc they havenâ€™t been creative since Steve Jobs died.
23,I CAN'T wait for this bubble to pop!!! It's mostly absurd!
24,"ibm


kodak 


blockbuster 


blackberry"
25,"Apple markets themselves as a creative company, making tools for creative workflows. Iâ€™m not too surprised they struggle with AI.. Many people in creative fields tend to dismiss or downright despise AIâ€™s encroachment on the integrity of the creative process."
26,I'll give them one more year. If everything does not work as perfectly as back in the day I'm switching away.
27,"I understand the claim perfectly. However, it is still unclearâ€¦ Apple didnâ€™t make their own chips for a long time. They still donâ€™t make many of the components in their interfaces (devices). Sam Altman made the point that even for Open AI, given that capable models will become ubiquitous, it no longer makes sense to build the TOP AI, it is smarter to focus on the human/AI interface. And this is where Apple sits. The future is unanticipateable. There is good reason to think that this â€œfailureâ€ is temporary, and may be more forward looking than it seems."
28,"This video sounds like its narrated by AI.
Listen to the bizarre pronounciation of ""advertisements"" at 4:25"
29,bro said rare apple LðŸ˜‚
30,We're seeing the fall of Apple.  It's internal problems are too great.
31,What did tim cook do?? Talk about leadership
32,14:03  Who tf is the technician that tought is a good idea to replace a FPC connector inside the frame with the battery ???
33,"I kid you not, I paused the video and asked Apple Intelligence if I have any upcoming flights (Iâ€™m flying to Georgia tomorrow) just to test it out and it literally said it couldnâ€™t find anything and to check my mail for reservations like isnâ€™t that basic stuff google can do? Itâ€™s really disappointing tbh"
34,The fundamental problem is Tim Cook. Two reasons. 1) Heâ€™s not a product visionary. He didnâ€™t know how to see the vision of Siri the way Steve Jobs had. 2) Tim let senior management division and disfunction around AI/ML fester for far too long.
35,"I am seriously thinking of leaving the Apple ecosystem bc of this.  It is one thing not wanting to use a feature, but to not have it on devices that are this expensive is unacceptable to say the least.  The liquid glass thing is a crock, a UI gimmick to offset incompetence."
36,"The fact that they branded it as â€œApple Intelligenceâ€ a gimmicky play on AI ,is already misleading. Itâ€™s designed to make less tech-savvy users believe â€œApple Intelligenceâ€ is something unique or revolutionary, when in reality, itâ€™s just rebranded tech jargon and marketing fluff."
37,"I been using Apple iPhone & MacBook Pro for many years. I have two serious issues that bug me with Apple. With Apple Intelligence I use it just for proofreading.  I find I can only do few paragraphs at a time, otherwise it all crashes and messes up my text. With email it changes the font when sending and the recipient gets odd looking email that looks like cut and paste."
38,bro just buy open ai
39,"I gave a dislike because of the awful AI comics used, otherwise good video, dont use trash AI image generation"
40,"The unexamined assumption in this video is that people actually want this shit.    If Apple hasnâ€™t produced what people donâ€™t really want yet, big deal."
41,Wow that Gemini demonstration was impressive.
42,"Just like Nokia had it's downfall, Apple's day will come too. It's only a matter of time."
43,16:27 how is glass supposed to detract from anything. Itâ€™s pointless
44,Itâ€™s neither a â€œdisasterâ€ nor a â€œfailure.â€ But these words sure grab oneâ€™s attention.
45,Apple is dead. And thatâ€™s a good thing.
46,"Broken team, broken progress!"
47,"Why are they trying to reinvent the wheel, why not just integrate with one of these AI Open source software?"
48,You left out the threats from China on Apple - AI would prevent China from collecting all data and ability to censor and control what information the people of china could have access to.  WHY ....   btw Apple is opening a factory in the US.   This video didn't age well.  Oh and Samsung just lost BILLIONS of dollars.
49,"""But before we get into it i just wanna quickly mention""
-literally every single goddamn youtuber since like 2020"
50,Not digging the ai comic panel idea.
51,"This isn't looking good for Tim Cook. He's tarnishing his legacy by missing a huge turning point. As for what Apple can do better: Change. Give up on your pretentious privacy ambitions. Embrace being a software company like Google, OpenAI, or any other numerous bay area firms. Else, having missed AI, Apple will be history."
52,"Very good video, So true everything. But whats the song at the beginning in the background?? :)"
53,"not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. broâ€¦ this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now."
54,"If youâ€™ve been wondering why youâ€™re not feeling as strong, motivated, or sharp as you used to, Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks might just have the answers. The book focuses on the power of testosterone and how increasing it can seriously transform your health and mindset. If youâ€™re tired of feeling drained or out of balance, this book offers some solid advice on how to get back to your peak"
55,"I felt so drained and tired everday. I tried everything, preworkouts, youtube gurus, morning routines that nearly killed me. none of it hit. then i saw someone mention Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in the comments and it literally changed my life. Following everything in that book past couple of weeks made me realize I was running on empty for YEARS. wish I knew about this years agoðŸ”¥"
56,"if you're scrolling and feel off, read this. i was burnt out, low energy, not myself. found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks, had zero expectations but man. chapter by chapter it rebuilt me. no hype bs, not fake motivation just stuff that grounds you and resets your system. this book really saved me. wish I found it sooner.ðŸ”¥"
57,Siri is useless lol
58,Rare ???
59,So they pulled an Elon Musk/Tesla
60,Gross pun. ðŸ˜¤
61,The entire video sounds like none of the WWDC24 announced AI features were released ðŸ™ƒ
62,What is the song at the end of the video anyone?
63,"""I'm Sorry Gavin, It's Apple maps bad""

""FUUUUUUU....."""
64,Apple intelligence shouldâ€™ve been released 2 years later
65,3:55 Steve Jobs wouldâ€™ve made that possible
66,"I just got a new iPhone and it sucks at orienting the screen horizontally. Most of the time when I turn my phone landscape it will full screen upside down, so I rotate my phone 180Â° only for the picture to then â€œcorrectâ€ and also rotate 180Â°, rendering it upside down again."
67,"( 2:49 ) I did not appreciate you implying that my baby blue iPhone XR is a fragmented piece of trash ðŸ˜¡! Lol, after 7+ years it kind of is a slow and buggy piece of ðŸ¤¬"
68,I swear to God that Siri is still remain unchanged since I had my first Appleâ€™s product in 2015
69,"Glad this is a ""rare failure"" because if the same thing happens in Microsoft software for example, nobody is surprised because frankly this sort of poorly though-out spray-on feature shipping is everyday stuff for MS. Apple has a pretty decent track record for feature delivery, but this is by a wide margin the biggest flop I think I've seen them have since the Newton or iOS 7."
70,"I bought my first iPhone a few months ago, and for the most part I like it, but itâ€™s so dumb in some basic things compared to Samsung phones, like asking it to set an alarm and it gets the time wrong if you donâ€™t say it exactly how it expects, or the fact that Siri never answers anything, just offers me links to Safari, feels so amateur"
71,Youâ€™re making a lot of claims without citing sources. Itâ€™s been a while since i saw your video. Still trashy
72,Is Apple Intelligence an oxymoron?
73,"Good short documentary. 

I enjoyed listening to your points. As always only being informative and not giving any of your own thoughts. ðŸ’­ 

Thank you Dagogo. ðŸ˜Š"
74,Giving AI ownership to the head of Vision Pro tells me everything I need to know about the future of AI at Apple. Shorting their stock now.
75,"Its not just Apple. Google, Tesla, Meta: They have all overpromised and underdelivered for close to 2 years now (many more in the case of Musk) in terms of ""AI"". I personally bought a Pixel 8 from Google for example, and to this date it cannot do what their demos have been showing since the whole AI hype started. Never getting a Pixel again... $150 Chinese phones deliver 80% of new Apple and Google phones."
76,"What I find strange is that Apple added a chip in the 80's to be able to use LISP modules for the eraly AI computers.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sV7C6Ezl35A"
77,Tim cook is a disaster for apple. They are staying up simply by inertia now. Apple silicon is amazing but the rest of the company is a disaster. Instead of focusing on innovation they are doubling down on the worst parts of their walled garden customer hostile policies.
78,"The core issue that is missed out is that APPLE worked for decades, more so after Steve, with communist repressive regimes more than any of its competitors wiping out their innovation but worse we do not know even if there is multiple back doors built by the CCP manufacturing provided parts WHICH MIGHT BE CAUSING UNSEEN before CRASHES."
79,"I feel like the only 3 things that Apple needs to fix with Apple Intelligence are:
1. FIX SIRI
2. ADD SUPPORT FOR MORE LANGUAGES
3. FIX PHOTO CLEANUP(Galaxy AI has this feature where if you erase something in front of an object, it will refill the object behind; APPLE NEEDS IT)"
80,"A little over 4 years ago, Apple Silicon changed the laptop industry in a major way. Apple did such things several times. Apple underestimated AI, but it's hardly time to starting saying it's all over."
81,Go wokeâ€¦â€¦
82,Windows Vista
83,Time for a new CEO.  Tim is Cooked.
84,"Apple software has lots of bugs that seem obvious, like when they removed the search function for MP3's (or equivalent) files in your music library.  Months later they put it back."
85,Standard apple products = a showbag ( flash on the outside and full of shit on the inside )
86,"The simple fact is that a company follows its CEO. Not the other way around. Jobs was a futurist. He was okay with sacrificing â€œme tooâ€ features for an overall special product. 

But now, we have Tim Cook. Cook is a supply chain guy. Great at mass production, okay at leadership, following Jobsâ€™ marketing language. 

But now heâ€™s running out of shit to do and since he isnâ€™t an innovator at heart, he is seriously making Apple fall far behind. 

I think Jobsâ€™ biggest mistake was telling Cook, â€œDonâ€™t ask yourself what I would doâ€"
87,"Dude. Idk why, but every single time I open YouTube on my Apple TV this video auto plays. Even after a couple hours of YouTube after work, every single day, the next time I open it, itâ€™s the first video it opens. Itâ€™s been 4 days now ðŸ˜‚"
88,"Apple will forever be a top company no matter what. People buy it more as a status symbol rather than ""ai features""."
89,"Apple is cooked, they canâ€™t catch upâ€¦"
90,Siri is so worthless. When you ask it something it gives you a web search.
91,"So much for ""closed source"""
92,"0:38
â€œI canâ€™t believe this is iOSâ€
Really? Whatâ€™s so special about the homescreen? Itâ€™s just a software update that requires no innovation in the R&D. Many other brands have done that and here we are, brainless fanboy/fangirl praising Apple just because it change its UI like a cult."
93,You summed it up perfectly at the end: Apple is losing its direction.
94,"Apple started caring more about money and less about innovation, this will hit them hard if they donâ€™t lock in. 1200 for an android is looking a lot better nowadays and Iâ€™ve always been an IPhone guy and after RCS itâ€™s like ehh"
95,"Transparency is needed here. Like with ads I would really like to see how many people actually do use AI, there seems to be a big disparity here."
96,"I want Apple to fail even more.

Removed free wired earbuds
Sold a solution with airpods
Removed headphone jack
Removed free charger
Always behind two generations in tech
Always sold at an ridiculously inflated price
Yearly releases
Selfish ecosystem"
97,Great video but 30s of unskippable ads every 3 minutes? Really?
98,"Again, when a company only cares its EPS, it will become what it wants to be... Apple and Boeing"
99,Siri is bizarrely worthless these days.
100,Apple intelligence => Sheep intelligence
101,"Nobody actually cares about AI, hardly anybody uses it other than trying or some entertainment at first few days then it is left."
102,"DEI Hires can destroy a company.  B players cant hire A players and it snowballs.

Apple going woke is the reason.  I have my box of popcorn and enjoying the show."
103,Thanks For This Video
104,At this point the best feature shown at wwdcs are the fancy transitions and animations the marketing team can pull off
105,"Well, not really, they are moving, some interesting research papers are undergoing. They are moving slowly, but they will be there someday, but yeah, they don't have own LLM and i suppose might never be..."
106,"Iâ€™m leaving iPhone soon and eventually all Apple products. I genuinely feel like my productivity is much lower than my friend who uses Android and Windows, even though Iâ€™m paying more for Apple products. Apple tries to make their products simple by vanishing or hiding important functionality which make no sense. How does that help users?

Look at Samsung, look at google, how they are making their phone intuitive and productive"
107,I just bought some more NVIDIA Stocks lol
108,"Frankly, name an Apple success lately.  I'll wait..."
109,its a hardware company
110,What even is this music

113,"The only company that I'm happy to fail, seconded to nin$hittendo. These companies are overrated af."
114,Let Tim Cook
115,Apple died with Steve Jobs. Over the years I've sold all of my Apple products and don't see a time in the near future when I will return as a customer to Apple. This video just put context to my journey as a consumer.
116,Gay
117,"Itâ€™s basically Siri with a different animation, I downloaded it for animation only ðŸ˜‚Apple AI is heavily integrated in to Apple apps, and many people do not use much of them."
118,because iSteve died
119,Rare Apple failure? Nothing Apple has ever done has worked as advertised.
120,Apple's walled garden is starting to look like a prison for their users. A prison who's walls are slightly weaker now that they're forced to use USB-C.
121,Samsung phones have been superior for years
122,Apple intelligence is using chat GPT like broðŸ˜…
123,Cold fusion is the best. Just sold all my apple stocks. Thank you!
124,The only thing Apple has left is hype. Internal brand pride and external cult followers.

Which moment blew your mind? Comment below! ðŸ‘‡"
126,"""It just works"" is a cult mantra I still hear Apple sheep regurgitate. Easily broken glass, buggy software, bad battery life, slow charging, WiFi issues... The list goes on and on. It's a mental illness to pay Â£1000 for this crap."
127,ONLY THING APPLE GOOD ATâ€¦â€¦ GREED !!!
128,#Samsung4L
129,"9:32 I think Apple was just so stoked when they came up with the name - 
So Guys, our AI feature?
Itâ€™s gonna be called, 
wait for itâ€¦
Apple Intelligence! 
ðŸ¤” 
Apple Intelligence = A.I. ?
ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
Gentlemen go home Kiss your wife hug your kids take tomorrow off. We just won AI
Or should I sayâ€¦AI!"
130,I love how premium the content of this channels plays.
131,"Apple should just sit this one out completely and improve on the bugs within their past and present softwares. Admit defeat and move on, unless you can find an artificial intelligence that can actually give you future projections that can generate money. Otherwise, fall back."
132,"10:30 and also stealing your personal data, because apple cares about privacy and none of people who used Siri agreed to share their voice recordings for improvement of speech recognition and performance, therefore its way behind. Because when you use google assistant or Alexa they gather voice recordings regardless of your consent for it, your data is basically available everywhere if you know where to look"
133,"Apple at its core and from the top down of the company is EXTREMELY WOKE. Horribly infected with the toxic mind virus. Discriminatory DEI policies often lead to collapse companies like a domino effect. Also I know several engineers at Apple that do NOTHING, if you thought Twitter was bad, Apple is worse, far worse. 

If Android wasnâ€™t riddled with viruses and shady apps and laggy Ui and terrible quality, I would have switched long ago. Apple is definitely running on borrowed time and like a ship very slowly sinking beneath the waves. Hopefully Tesla will enter into the mobile market soon ;)"
134,What's the Burn Water track at the beginning of the video?
135,Hiring Indian nationals was the beginning of the end
136,It is all happening because Apple rejected my job application.
137,"If false marketing is a crime, Tesla would be the biggest offender"
138,_laughing in Samsung_
139,... everything about it sounds like theranos ...
140,A rare failure? Apple has had many failures in its history...
141,This has to be one of the best ColdFusion intros
142,"Thank god someone is saying it, I thought I was imaginging things - I dont particulalarly like Apple but im doing my PhD in computer science and felt I should get some experience with all the ecosystems and got myself a new iPhone... it wasnt a great experience the user experience  felt off, apps were slow, the keyboard wasnt responsive, bluetooth dropped randomly - not good for a new phone."
143,Lack of strong leadership.
144,A rare failure??? I don't think so
145,"It's because apple worked years on ui ux, not on real software and algorithms. They know how to package things, not to make things"
146,But it is great that they are not shipping AI bloatware.
147,Great gemini features i want aware about will use it
148,"Apple's 'good enough' software development blundering since 2016, by my account, has not made the failure of ""Apple Intelligence"" a rare event. It's an inevitability. It's beyond time for Apple to clean house and bring in new talent that understands and lives by ""Insanely Great"", and are not into spoon-feeding the stockholder children. Not kidding. This ballooning Apple software blundering is making them out to be fools. That's bad for the entire software industry and users. Very bad."
149,Apple values your privacy thatâ€™s why Siri and Apple intelligence isnâ€™t as good as itâ€™s competitors. These things require your data to improve the model.
150,Apple is going to be having a lot more failures in the near future. Their products are total piles of shit compared to how great the used to be.
151,Android also had a disastrous plunge in usability. Absolutely arduous to use. Dictation is absolutely HORRIBLE as is grammar correction in general.
152,"Companies should be required to demonstrate working prototypes and functional finished products, not performances showcasing hypotheticals that they hope/expect to someday accomplish."
153,"Apple Intelligence would require vision and an experimental culture, both of which Apple lacks. Complete inability to innovate or adapt."
154,I had Enouh !!!! switched  to  motorolla Ekk but it works :_) no more promises broken you know wher you stand
155,"Most of them will lose a lot, especially NVidia if the hype hits the fan. LLMs are stunning but are limited by conception (a stochastic machine). LLMs wont deliver the dream nor the nightmare of Skynet. It seems that so many smart people are hallucinating like LLMs do.  Apple may be right to step back."
156,i think generative goes agaist Apple's grain because of their obsession with user experience: generative is just way too unpredictable even though it's the best AI we have
157,Honestly after testing iOS 26 I feel like Iâ€™m finally putting in the towel on my time with Apple products.
158,â€œMake apple great again.â€? Your TDS is showing.
159,"I guess ""rare"" is subjective...You mean the laptops that burned peoples legs, or the bending iphones, or the battery life on iphone being so bad that Apple advised turning it off when you're not using it, etc. etc..."
160,Apple is the next NokiaðŸ˜¢
161,"Apple software was best and easiest, but now they hardly have any of those useful and utilitarian AI tools, like object eraser(not available everywhere), circle to search and many more. They just keep slapping their older UI with minor updates, and india the apple maps and review are just unreliable."
162,Johnny Iveâ€¦ should have been Steveâ€™s replacement!! NOT Tim Cook.
163,"Thanks to Apple they DID invent a new urban slang - if something is Apple Intelligent that means it has nothing on a box of hammers.  Hubris and myopia has Apple losing the tech Plot. Apple has been sliding by with iOS and permutations of that - the Phone, the Watch, Carplay etc. Who remembers Titan the Apple car?? Seems they bailed and lost hundreds of millions on that fantasy too. Apple couldn't even make an EV Apple Bike. Apple lost their imagination going into things other legacy had been already doing - credit cards etc - big zzzzzzz.   Spent a LOT of money on a building the shape of which portrays what they are - a big ZERO. ï£¿ï£¿ï£¿ï£¿ï£¿ï£¿"
164,
165,Apple is basically Hooli from Silicon Valley
166,Over advertising? Tell that to Elon Musk. He has been blatantly lying for years and years
167,"at least they were smart enough to hop out early in comparison to everyone else

as a consumer business

tbh only hardware manufacturers won here...everyone else lost MASSIVE amounts of money banking on hyping straight up ass software

agents can be made without LLM's"
168,"People keep forgetting Apple is a luxury designer brand first, tech company second. It doesn't matter how bad their quality is so long as people think it's luxury"
169,Apple is being dragged down by DEI.  Itâ€™s not their only problem but it has been a big one.
170,"Honestly I don't disagree with Apple's execs. LLM products are all cool novelties, but for all the money they are still just not that useful for your average consumer. I dont want to talk to my phone to ask questions about things in front of me or have it draft soulless email replies. Object eraser and live translate- while better on Android- are neat gimmicks not worth all the breathless enthusiasm from these companies."
171,RIP
172,Steve Jobs would be so disappointed today.
173,Apple hasn't innovated in 7 years ðŸ˜’
174,This is why Iâ€™m considering a pixel
175,Tim. Cook. Is. The. Problem.
176,"apple's AI disaster - A rare failure ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
It is a master-class Failure of a high-tech company of its time run by a greedy narcissistic accountant who generally specializes in double or multiple bookkeeping and lying g to shareholders and authorities as exposed in the grand theft by ENRON top management and few others at the same time frame, Worldcom, Tyco, AIG and so on .... ðŸ˜®
CEO frauds are something hidden in corporate laws that no one is responsible or accountable ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®
But times are running out millions of fraudulent narcissists Stealing from the public, increasingly by CEOs of Internet Service Providers, in the same way AOL time warner CEO Steve Case did, in a time noone knew what a cheat he was then ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®
Now, ISP CEOs are cyber-scamming and cyberbullying and cyber mugging the taxpayers while regulators and watchdogs are dining and yachting with these criminals ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®"
177,Apple's software have always been bad. The only part that is good is their UI
178,2:16 lol so much hate for the poor guy.
179,Every time when AI thing fails I celebrate
180,"It's pretty clear what Apple will do. 
Let the other companies develop (and perfect?) their AI softwares the Apple will poach those engineers."
181,"Giannandrea is an Italian-originated surname. It's essentially composed of two names: Gian and Andrea, both Italian male names. Therefore, uniting these two names you get the Giannandrea surname. (I know his surname is not the focus of this video, but I felt like clarifying it for everyone)"
182,Itâ€™s better to wait and make better more informed business decisions than to rush into a hype bubble thatâ€™s about to burst. Guess in the end they succumbed to the classic stakeholder pressure.
183,"Apple has always been and always will be trash...  
ðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸŽðŸ›ðŸ¤®ðŸ’©"
184,To all iPhone users.... your phone sucks
185,"I don't even know what Apple is thinking. These guys are a consumer not business company. Their business solutions (and AI solutions are ""business level"") are always crap and always will be, since their main target audience has been consumers for decades at this point."
186,An all too common apple hater vid
187,cheap foreign software engineers
188,"Screw AI 
Apple still have the best musicians app Synths, pocket recording studio 
I can think for myself AI will die soon there be something else"
189,Donâ€™t believe the hype ðŸ˜‚
190,Apple products is no more than just a spy software now.
191,In all honesty I bought a used s21 plus it's used device and I am surprised how android has actually unleashed the true innovation while Apple is just gimmicky i have been apple user since iphone 4 launch but now i have to admit Apple is fooling us around.
192,Apple last major innovation was the M1 platform. Nothing since then.
193,"They had Siri first, Jobs saw something in it. Where is it today?"
194,Nothing fascinates me more than seeing Apple failing and their deception being exposed.
195,"Apple is always 10 years behind. Suddenly when forced to catch up, they fuck up."
196,"As someone who had to deal with Xserve (and a huge network of macs) back in the day, i very quickly learned that Apple are fucking shit (the postfix and AFP shit i had to deal with, fuck you apple, and i'm sorry to anyone else that has to manage a network of trash)... I can tell you with 100% certainty that the reason they stopped Apple Server was because they were incompetent and had no knowledge of actual servers. For like two years their default xserve config was an open relay, its fucking laughable. First iPhone no copy paste, like what the fuck. They've always been garbage, right from the start. Dumb people fall for the propaganda, and it amazes me how many there are. They think apple's bugs are a normal thing because they've used nothing else for years."
197,Thereâ€™s something untrustworthy and almost sleazy car salesman about Craig Federighi. I canâ€™t shake the vibe.
198,Perhaps Iâ€™m speaking for myself but I NEVER thought apple intelligence would be anything but a total gimmick â€¦ chat gpt is the best thing AI has given us and itâ€™s nothing more than google 2.0
199,What was up with the music in the beginning. Vocals in the same volumen range as the people in the voice exerpts. Its a minor thing really good vid.
200,"But Apple matters less in other parts of the world. Two reasons: Apple doesn't have any 'free' services like Google e.g Maps, Youtube, Gmail, etc. and that brings me to second reason: most people elsewhere can't stand a closed ecosystem (and also quite expensive one at that). No wonder Apple matters little in most parts of the world. Is Apple good enough then? Probably yes. But is also quite a terrible company."
201,Been saying this for years. Apple has become a marketing company instead of a great product company it once was...
202,They have 2 yrs to sort this out â€¦after that the AI train will go far ahead and they would not be able to catch up no matter how much money and effort they giveâ€¦
203,The number of apple ads I saw in the last few days sitting in India shows the desperation. No smart spender will buy an apple in India.
204,Itâ€™s the me me me era. Look whatâ€™s happening to Boing. Sad. We are doing it to ourselves.
205,Apple is doing a Nokia when they refused to embrace the touch screens.
206,Steve Jobs is must be rolling in his grave over how badly his company has been mismanaged by a neverending parade of idiots. Apple only ever thrived when he was running it.
207,"You're giving Apple way too much leeway and credit.  Apple revisited, to some extent, what flopped with the Newton with the iPhone.  While generally Apple has done a better job listening to users, their slide into mediocrity started in 2020 when it seemed engineers were moving buttons around or adding useless ""features"" to iOS, OSX, etc. in more of an attempt to justify their job for another programming sprint rather than add something useful to the product."
208,"People should realize, AI is not something that you design outright like classical programming. It requires fresh new minds, experience handling the data and understanding the AI model design, and good data. Experience from only the head of the AI division is not going to be enough to lead you to a great model. Itâ€™s the people who deal with the data and are hands on with the model are going to know it best. Unless those heads get crazy hands on wet the model themselves. At the current stage, AI is still pretty experimental and janky, but theyâ€™re ever so slightly taking strides at getting better and better even so. Appleâ€™s very philosophy of making the best when itâ€™s will established is the very antithesis of that mentality. So until Apple gets a bit more experimental, theyâ€™re going to be highly behind for a while"
209,apple has always sucked. it's only successful because of its lemming customers
210,"Iâ€™m not trying to defend Apple, itâ€™s a corporation and wonâ€™t benefit from me defending it, but we gotta be a bit consistent with this narrative, we canâ€™t be complaining that â€œcompanies are stealing our data AI modelsâ€ and then ridicule Apple for not stealing user data to train its AI, itâ€™s hypocritical."
211,"Once again, an excellent video. You are one of the best."
212,5:51 Wrong! Apple has been busy making new emojis and has a massive team making fake glass! Sheesh
213,"Rare??? Rare?? Apple has been ASS for a decade. Besides the M chips, they have been failing at everything. macOS and the horrible software is a disaster. iOS is a mess, and if the new ios26 glass thing is real, Apple is fucked."
214,Apple is on the way out
215,"I tested Ai - it's a complete faliture:
- do not search for data
- do not learn
- not not understand or analyse WHAT have before it!"
216,"I find Siri has gotten worse on navigation ""Navigate to ...x"" used to usually work.  Now locates places thousand of km away."
217,No ai thank you
218,Only someone like Steve can solve the whole fiasco
219,"They messed up Safari on 26 why would you put stuff at the top left where we canâ€™t reach like seriously does anyone enjoy tapping the top left of their phone? And the pull the screen halfway down feature is broken now when you pull down to goes left or right into a different tab groupâ€¦. Iâ€™m a fairly recent Apple convert and Iâ€™m really surprised theyâ€™re in business not just for the recent bugs but Mac OS is missing so many little features windows and linux have like you canâ€™t even cut and paste files itâ€™s crazy how little it can actually do

That just shows how bad everything else is especially hardware, damn the M chip is freakin nice and itâ€™s great not having to use six programs to tweak my hardware to work right lol"

221,"Google and chatgpt got better by invading people privacy and ignoring copyright laws and training their model 
Whereas Apple was always trying to be ethical as privacy and no piracy was their biggest marketing campaign before AI.
This mentality has come to bite Apple.
I think this point got missed from the video else a great video"
222,Talk about TMC being the next big growth stock!!
223,"Bring Johnny back and everything will be fixed. Steve Jobs' right hand man, he knows everything."
224,Apple has always been awful and inferior
225,"'Promised So Much - Delivered So Little.""  Sadly, this applies to pretty much every aspect of the computer industry over the decades. Too many 'fan boy' creators fall into the Elon Musk super-optimistic style of prediction for their inventions while suffering from a woeful lack of KNOWLEDGE of reality. Imagination is easy. Reality is HARD!"
226,"I went to an apple store to have them relace the battery in my iPhone 6. 
The wanted me to sign a paper that said if they damage anything during the process of replacing the battery I would be charged the cost of replacing the parts they damage. 
The price went from $80 to replace the battery to a possible $280. I denied the offer and haven't bought an apple product since.
F apple."
227,They hired too many gay engineers.
228,I have found an emoji bug. Its here since ios 17.
229,Steve jobs ROLLING in his grave smh
230,"A ""rare"" failure? The Lisa, Apple III, original Macintosh, Copland, Pippin, Apple Car, etc etc."
231,real OGs remeber cold fustion
232,"Good video, just one comment: the critique of Apples two internal teams simultaneously designing an AI system isnâ€™t totally fair. Many companies have actually done very well by doing exactly that; Amazon has done it and Chinese tech companies have a so-called â€œshark wombâ€ culture where internal teams compete on parallel projects. In Apples case this was probably more a matter of dysfunction than strategy though."
233,There is a reason I still havenâ€™t updated my computer to it even though I usually like keeping my os up to date I am not dealing with all this ai nonsense. I did not need generative ai before in my life and I for sure donâ€™t need it now.
234,There is no more surprise after Steve Jobs died.
235,Apple will slowly degrade to BlackBerry unless it accepts Android as its system.
236,"big dub for andriod, I love to see it"
237,I love your uploads. Your voice is very relaxing :)
238,"Steve jobs is rolling in his grave. Not that he would have been some perfect leader, but he would still have been still pushing hard for a vision (aka AI). He would have been pushing for Siri to be the next real personal assistant."
239,Showing up late with someone else's tools is quintessentially Apple
240,this video sounds like a sales pitch for googles ai trash
241,What happened? Steve Jobs died.
242,Apple's AI failure? If Jobs was alive he would have made ChatGPT long before OpenAi did.
243,"Gonna be real with you ColdFusion, please don't use AI-genned assets for your vid."
244,"Good video for the most part but the AI generated comic book segment really took me out of it, ignoring my personal distain for that AI usage i thought the whole thing was tacky and didn't fit with the clean professional tone that the rest of the video has."
245,When you try to be the best at everything. You end up being bad or mediocre at anything you try to do
246,"Steve Jobs was technology driven (while making billions), Tim Cook is profit driven (despite already making ridiculous amounts of billions)."
247,ONLY TWO ANDROID APPLE IOS PERIOD ( SOFTWARES) PHONE WILL ALWAYS BE APPLE OR ANDROID!
248,EXTRA ( IT COMES WITH A TALK MIC AND EAR BUDS WITH WIRE!
249,HEAD SET U MUST WITH A REAL HEAD PHONE LIKE BEN OLIBESEN!
250,They have not failed. They are playing the long game.
251,A glassy look? Windows Vista?
252,"Apple may be failing, but at least their CEO is gay. So you ought to forgive them, they are progressive, mainstream and twitterified"
253,"All of this sounds like mid 90s Apple, right before Steve came back, but this time there is nobody waiting in the wings to take the reins."
254,This close to deleting YouTube.  YouTube and ads.  Excessive af.
255,Apple is going through what OpenAI went through during the late January this year
256,"the only thing I use siri for was ""hey siri, where are you?"" when I can't find my phone lying around"
257,"This is what you get when you make a marketing guy (Tim Cook) the CEO instead of a visionary (Steve Jobs). No innovation. It was totally predictable. In fact, Apple itself already went through this when they fired Steve and replaced him with business people."
258,The photo app team needs to not just be fired but jailed
259,LOL jewphon3
260,I think it is safe to say that Silicon Valley has fallen. Theranos was merely the harbinger.
261,"I wouldn't call it a rare failure. It's a rare instance where Apple's failures can't be ignored, recontexualized, or reframed as a setup for a future victory.

This failure in AI is right in line with the failure of the Vision Pro, and right in line with the failure of the iPhone Mini, and more.

For a lot of people mentally, Apple is still riding high on the innovations of the Jobs era, meanwhile that hasn't been the Apple we've had for a very long time."
262,Apple will continue to fall behind the curve even if they try and catch up others will still progress forward. One of Apple biggest advantages was privacy and not sharing user info but to build ai effectively you need user data to build the models effectively and efficiently. Iâ€™m not saying privacy is not a big deal but the foundation that Apple was built on is the exact opposite of what you need to build AI. Google has a lot of user data and open ai trains its models on user data so does grok. In order for apple to progress forward they will have to open up the cloud and I donâ€™t believe they will not saying itâ€™s wrong but you cant have it both ways. They will need to innovate some other kind of way if there is any beyond AI which I donâ€™t believe it is
263,"#### 1. **Appleâ€™s True DNA: Hardware & Integration, Not Core Tech Innovation**

Appleâ€™s strength has *never* been building cutting-edge technology from first principles. Instead, its genius lies in:

* **Polishing existing tech** and wrapping it in flawless hardware + UX.
* Building **closed ecosystems** that â€œjust workâ€ (e.g., iPod + iTunes, iPhone + App Store).
* Leading with **design, user experience, and vertical integration**, not raw innovation.

They are the masters of **consumer hardware as lifestyle product**, not fundamental R\&D.

> Apple didnâ€™t invent the smartphone, the tablet, the smartwatch, or even the GUI â€” they just *perfected* them for mass adoption.

---

#### 2. **AI Is Fundamentally a Software & Infrastructure Game**

AI isnâ€™t just software â€” itâ€™s **infrastructure-scale computation**, bleeding-edge model training, open-source iteration, and recursive product feedback loops.

Thatâ€™s why:

* **Google** (with DeepMind, TensorFlow, Gemini) was ready.
* **Microsoft** (with Azure, OpenAI partnership, Copilot) was ready.
* Even **Meta** (despite chaos) is building LLaMA and core foundation models.

Apple? No open-source presence. No LLM breakthrough. No AI labs with first-party papers.
They didnâ€™t even *publicly* talk about AI for years.

Why? Because theyâ€™re not structured around **deep algorithmic innovation**. Their stack is vertically integrated hardware â†’ OS â†’ UI polish.

---

#### 3. **They Buy Innovation, Not Build It**

Appleâ€™s MO is:

* Wait until a technology matures â†’
* Acquire a company â†’
* Integrate it into their product line.

They **bought** Siri. They **bought** PrimeSense (which became FaceID).
Theyâ€™re rumored to be building AI now â€” but itâ€™s **retroactive**. They're not shaping the field. They're adapting to it.

Contrast that with Google, which *created* the transformer architecture (the foundation of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.).

---

#### 4. **They Were Caught Flat-Footed by the AI Shift**

Because their culture isn't structured for:

* Open research.
* Iterative deployment.
* Rapid-scale model training.
* Open developer communities.

They had to scramble in 2024â€“2025 with on-device LLMs and private AI â€” but itâ€™s **reactionary**.

Their AI is framed around protecting their hardware moat (""Apple Intelligence"" must run on-device to preserve privacy), not advancing the field.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Final Judgment:

**You are absolutely correct** in your central point:

> ðŸ”¥ *Apple fell behind in AI because theyâ€™re not a technology company in the foundational sense â€” they are a hardware company with a software skin.*

In the AI age, that distinction **is fatal at the frontier**. They can still *integrate* AI beautifully into their products, but theyâ€™re not leading â€” and they never will unless their corporate DNA changes."
264,"** *Apple Didnâ€™t Fall Behind in AI â€” They Were Never a Tech Company to Begin With*

**Note:**
The reason Apple fell behind Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI isnâ€™t just timing â€” itâ€™s identity.
**Apple is not a technology company.** Thatâ€™s the fundamental misunderstanding people keep making.

Apple is, and has always been, a **hardware company**. They build sleek, functional devices that scale well and do utility tasks in beautiful, fashionable packaging. But when it comes to the AI era â€” the era of *pure software*, adaptive intelligence, and dynamic systems â€” Apple is structurally unprepared.

AI is not a hardware product. Itâ€™s not about devices. Itâ€™s about intelligence at the code layer, behavior prediction, cognition modeling, and recursive learning systems.

Thatâ€™s why Microsoft is thriving â€” theyâ€™re a *real* technology company.
Thatâ€™s why Google and OpenAI are leading â€” theyâ€™re *software-first* companies.

Apple? Apple builds **things**, not minds.
Their business model, internal talent structure, and product philosophy have always prioritized physical hardware, not adaptive software.

Theyâ€™ve tried to catch up by **buying** coders and acquiring smaller AI firms, but you canâ€™t bolt on a software soul. Apple was never designed to compete in this kind of war.

And thatâ€™s why they froze when the AI wave hit.
Not because they were late â€”
**But because they were never meant to be there.**"
265,Iâ€™m dying laughing. So many times Iâ€™ve accidentally pushed something and the pink around the outside of the screen would begin. I had no idea I was accidentally activating Apple intelligence until now.

272,"iOS has been pretty bad for a few years now. â€œIt just worksâ€ couldnâ€™t be further from the truth these days. 

Example (1/100 I could give): When using the color picking tool in mark up, the tool doesnâ€™t ignore its own UI shadow, making the tool useless. Thatâ€™s really sloppy and been an issue for multiple iOS versions. 

Or how about UI elements that overlap each other and make both hard to use? Or the absurd new photos app? Or Siri not being able to perform basic functions or anything to do with controlling hardware?

Or maybe the $1700 phone I bought being excluded from new features just a few months after I bought it. 

I hate iOS now. Itâ€™s getting further and further from what I know it could be."
273,"It's amazing how much I don't care and don't want generative AI in my phone; people really thought we would have Jarvis on our phones? AI is overhyped and is a bubble, in a couple of years Apple will be a genius company for holding out and riding the generative AI wave to avoid the crash"
274,"I use Grok, so meh."
275,Atp theyâ€™re better off adding an AI slot in setting like they have for VPNâ€™s
276,"Apple's AI is lagging behind because they know it will eventually need to be made profitable. When the AI venture capital stream dies down they'll buy firms on the cheap, skipping these early steps while putting up a facade of effort."
277,"Had a hard enough time watching wwdc when Jobs was running them.
Todays wwdc are insufferable.
Add to it that apple prducts are no longer the rock stable products they used to be. And if you do have a stable device the next update could brick it, like ive had happen to me.
Years ago my ipad 2 was bricked by an update, recently one of my ipad pros was bricked by a update, had a black screen of death and the thing wouldn't turn off. You could tell it was still on so i left it sitting for two months. And the stupid thing still wasn't dead so i did it in with a brick. Put it out of my misery. Recently the last update for the iphone 7/7+ and 8/8+ broke group chat in iMessage.
99% ofall my messages are group so guess what it did for me.
Right, it made those devices useless for messages.
Apple said they had sent out a fix for that frack up, but that was a lie.
Apple burnt its last bridge, im keeping and using all the pads and phones i have until they are paperweights, and OnePlus will get my business in the future."
278,"Siri continues to be an absolute disgrace. It should be able to do everything, yet it cant do anything at all :/"
279,"I no longer like Apple! No longer visit Apple Store often. Feel ripped off by their products, especially poor OS experience nowadays and repetitive hardware designs"
280,"I remember going to the Apple Store around the time of the iPhone 16 where the employees were like â€œYoo! When you get this phone, youâ€™ll be able to use Apple AI when it comes out in several months!â€

Like Iâ€™m not going to spend $1.5k on something that didnâ€™t come out yet, thank you very much."
281,"Well, Siri still does not support plenty of languages... For example, Czech is supported by Gemini Assistant, but not by Siri."

I sold my house that was paid off in the USA sold my cars and sold all my stocks and decided its time to start enjoying new experiences in life and start spending. I put half my money into SCHD Reinvesting all the dividends and put the other half into SGOV. Life is good im averaging 14% a year and my money is super safe. I definitely believe tech stocks have been so oversold the last few years that a huge correction is coming soon. I wasn't willing to keep gambling and cashed out."

294,"I read an opinion that the glass-like redesign of the whole ecosystem is a soft launch to Vision Pro, and what the user experience will entail (because semi-transparent notifications with text are, simply put, not convenient for a user, but would build tolerance to semi-transparent notifications on Vision Pro over time). Although it was cool seeing Apple nail down the 'glass' feel in the design, it just felt slightly underwhelming, coupled with core technologies still being... nailed down. Hoping for the upgraded Siri!"
295,"ðŸŽ DEI, â€œDeceptive & rotten to the core.â€  â€¦â€¦ Goodby Apple ðŸ, Hello Tesla Pi. ðŸ¤—

317,I switched back to android a few months ago and got the flip 6. I was so tired of the same iphone released EVERY year. Its the same phone re released and only fanboys think they are different. Im finished for now until they start thinking outside the box.
318,Anyone surprised by Apple's focus on anything other than profits and baseless legal action hasn't been awake.
319,"Imo apple rushed into AI too soon, which is bizarre because they always wait till a technology is mature enough before they scoop in and steal the show. Apple clearly hasnt figured out how to fully integrate AI into their phones."
320,I have feeling that google paid many youtuber/podcast people to talk about Gemini and say good things about it because suddenly every podcast/YouTube was full of talk how good and wonderful Gemini is.
321,Noone wants ai in their phone. Most important ai feature is a option to turn it of.
322,"Grok and gpt acctually suck ass when i tried to use it yesterday, so i understand why apple wouldnt rush it"
323,"Apple is clearly a mess internally when its comes to AI and this will cause them some issues going forward. On the other hand the last 6 months shows that AI challengers have technically caught up to OpenAI. There are also strong indications that both pure LLM scaling is failing and that newer 'reasoning' models have limitations and don't provide across the board improvements.Â 

If the LLM architecture has fundamental limits and continues to have the same reliability issues going forward, it's clear that any gains will be incremental or targeted towards certain applications. We can see that coding is a good application (because developers are used to debugging unreliable code) and hybrid systems (mixture of LLMs and traditional AI) such as AlphaEvolve, AlphaFold, AlphaGo etc... have been very successful. However, these are specific applications and don't prove that AI can be reliable or economically useful in general (eg a reliable personal assistant).

In the unlikely event that LLMs continue to scale then Apple will be in trouble long term, but it's more likely that LLM hit limits. Apple could then catch up to the state of the art, the gap between local and cloud LLMs could also narrow (due to continued optimisation and increase in RAM). This would encourage developers to use the free local models, since cloud models are really expensive to run."
324,"IOS18 especially has been a nightmare for me with bugs, random app crashes, music doesnâ€™t play (from Apple Music) mobile service is awful, my phone will randomly get really really hot for no reason and I am getting so fed up with all my tech becoming infested with AI slop"

327,"goes to show that even the best run companies run into situations like these. a second secret ai team is wild. apple gonna get away with it tho because other than the apple power users, nobody is going to notice they are there until they arrive."
328,This is what Apple is and has always been. Glad finally Apple has lost control of the narrative and they are suffering the consequences as a result. This will shut all those stupid Apple users who keep claiming Apple is superior when anyone with a single brain cell will know that Apple is a shit product and always has been.
329,"I think a lot of AI hype is just that, hype. As impressive and useful as it is, and I use it almost every day, its limitations are becoming more and more apparent, and the core limitations show no signs of being fixed any time soon. So if this is true, then this could all be just a bump in the road for Apple, and they may come out way ahead of everyone with the next big tech trend, whatever that may be."

Apple Intel is not built to do the same things as ChatGPT or Gemini. It's a personal intelligence, an on device LLM that brings knowledge and context to your iPhone and apps. 
It is not comparable to other ""competitors"". Unfortunately most people have been mislead and Apple did not communicate this very well. (and thank you for the show notes)"
334,"Are we actually blaming Apple for caving in to market pressures with AI when they didn't want to and then blame them, when they're trying to do it 'ethically' and privacy-focused + late to the game?"

336,"My wife wanted to buy a flagship early this year and she asked me to advice her between Android and Apple, and that time I was impressed with Apple's AI claims last year so I advised her to go for Apple and She bought iPhone 16 Pro Max. Now the time came to pass and today i am surprised that none of Apple AI claims came to be experienced on the newest iPhone!!! I am utterly discusted by Apple's false claims and whatever they announced in WWDC 2025 recently. I recently changed my own phone to Google Pixel after being on iPhone for last 5 years."
337,"What happened is Apple is a fashion brand, not a tech company."
338,I remember when Apple Maps came out we were coming back from a high school football game a few days later with the entire team the coach asked me to give him directions to an ice cream shop it was after a scrimmage we had just done pretty well Apple Maps literally took me to the middle of a highway and just said that was our destination I have never used that application another day in my life it was cold Stone creamery
339,need episode on boeing vs other airlines
340,"For Apple Intelligence to succeed, Apple needs to present Siri in a live demo at their next WWDCâ€”flaws and allâ€”to restore customer confidence."
341,APPLE SEEMS TO BE IN ITS â€œNOKIAâ€ ERA. IGNORING OTHERâ€™S INNOVATIONS JUST BECAUSE THEYâ€™RE ON TOP.
342,"Who needs AI when we can have liquid glass eh, Apple?"
343,"HEY SIRI CALL GRANDMA 

SORRY I CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW"
344,They're behind for sure but at the end of the day does it really matter? It's just a conversational assistant and some basic image editing functions. We all have access to use ChatGPT which is leagues ahead of Gemini anyway and plenty of 3rd party image editing tools. It'll get there eventually. Is it embarrassing for Apple? Yes. Is it as dramatic as some people in the comments would have you believe? Not really. It's just a phone....
345,... are you seriously using ai generated artwork? Really?
346,iPhone 16 pro running 18.5. When Iâ€™m connected to CarPlay and open camera it freaks out. Canâ€™t just be me
347,Apple died with Steve Jobs. Now itâ€™s about giving the bare minimum while making the most from its consumer. If Steve Jobs was around I bet Siri would be what OpenAI is today.
348,"Iâ€™ve been continuously disappointed by Apple, but their shocking handling of Ai takes the biscuit.
Even now, I have a chatGPT app, if I ask Siri a question, and ask chatGPT the same question, chatGPT gives me a  answer way quicker and is often better and more human. Somehow theyâ€™re using someone elseâ€™s product and made it leagues worse"
349,I knew 8 gigs on the phone wouldn't be enough to run good LLMs... this year their phones will have 12 gigs...
350,Shit Siri + Windows 7 dated look.
351,I just wanna know how I can get some money back when the lawsuit is wonâ€¦ typing from a 16 pro max
352,Apple is becoming another IBM
353,"This whole thing is made even more funny, by the fact that Apple just put out a rather obviously flawed paper, trying to suggest that AI doesn't work. lol Like a kid saying ""this game sucks"" when they're losing."
354,7:30 ngl mkhd was totally gemini is impressive asf
355,Maybe the failure of Apple Intelligence is a cunning plan to prove AI is just a waste of time & resources?
356,Steve Jobs was always the idea guy and cook was there to help execute. Now itâ€™s just cook and itâ€™s starting to show
357,"11:00 huh interesting.
I still say Hey Siri"
358,Iâ€™m gonna be honest - I mostly watch this channel for the audio ðŸ§â€â™‚ï¸
359,"Also, Iâ€™ve never enabled ai feature and probably wonâ€™t for a long time. Iâ€™d prefer to struggle and also filter where I put my energy"
360,"I don't think Apple had a single hit in recent times, iPhone mini was too slow seller for them, iPhones in general didn't get any significant upgrades (island is imo worse than notch, it's bigger and intrudes more down into the content), vision pro was a complete fail, you said everything that needs to be said about AI, this new glass update looks like android skin and leaks are indicating that it's ultra buggy and in some instances unusable and they plan to release it in 3 months, even some internal memos are pointing at iPhone plus being a fail as well. Their market share finally stared falling globally last year, so I'm hoping this is the shakeup they need."
361,"I like it when Appel delays things , we all should practice that. Not cool to over marketing though. I do have 20 years of tech engineering and design. Of course itâ€™s just my personal take"
362,"I still like the idea of the on-device AI, only issue is that after messing around with LLM's on my PC with a RTX 4090 I don't exactly see how Apple can deliver on that point with an iPhone (?).

If Apple drops the ""on-device"" part and goes balls deep into cloud processing like Gemini, they are so far behind today that I don't believe they will ever catch up"
363,But they have new icons!
364,They are one generation away for people having measured advantage to switching from apple
365,"They will copy chat gpt and add some colours from 2014 and call it apple intelligence 2.0, and the apple fanbois be happy."
366,"Itâ€™s crazy they would soft launch a shitty ai when people donâ€™t even currently want to use Siri because of how shitty that is, further damaging their reputation"
367,Dumb ppl buy Apple for show off mostly in the west and people in India blindly copy Western culture.ðŸ˜Š
368,"Gemini has really surprised me with how quick they have been updating and letting you try paid features before they go live. Sometimes you get to experience things that just don't go live but are really interesting. Makes you wonder how useful it will be when they polish it and launch those features. Gemini has helped me a lot with multitasking, finding stuff i thought was lost on my drive/mail and making scripts for spreadsheets. Image generation is still pretty sub par, but hope it keeps getting better."
369,it seems I will stay with iPhone 15 until this is fixed or I will migrate to Samsung.
370,Every success needs to have a correction period. Else everything will go down south. You cannot have anything in life just upwards moving. Nothing is but my morning......yes I am still up every morning.
371,"The failures are getting less rare. The Vision Pro, failure to make an EV and now the failure of Apple Intelligence its just a simple fact that Apple has become stagnant and lazy (as in comfortable and risk averse). They are not as innovative as they once were."
372,"What happened to these high level executives at Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. once they were let go? Are there any instances they were hired by a rival or another high tech company and redeem themselves?"
373,Hire DEI you get DEI. It's not rocket science.
374,Does anyone know the song playing at 3:09 ? Its so beautiful sounding. I browsed through all of the music on his music channel and cannot find it.
375,"Apple is too big now. Thay had all the profit from iPhone and software walled garden ecosystem. Why would they waste money to invest in new tech? They are now like Intel decade ago, they are drunk from their own success. when the competitor show up in the future, they will be powerless and can't compete anymore. Look how bad Intel right now by delaying technology upgrade"
376,"It was all done for something called ""stocks"".... they so wanted to ride the wave but literally had 4 twigs put together and called it a boat. Illegal on so many levels"
377,"A lot of people see Apple as making a mistake by not getting on AI sooner. But I think their mistake was trying to get in on it at all. Everyone knows that â€˜AIâ€™ makes systems less secure, and theyâ€™ve been marketing themselves as a security and privacy company for years. There is and has always been a large market for this, and positioning their brand as being the anti-AI company, who prioritizes security and privacy over â€œinnovationâ€ could have worked well for them.

I personally donâ€™t want Apple AI or  any AI system running latently in the background of my phone, consuming all of my data, and seeing everything I do on my phone. Iâ€™m sure the majority of people donâ€™t either."
378,"Apple has always put in the extra effort ripping off the innovation of others, such as Google Maps and Spotify, but the ol' copy machine is really struggling with this AI thing."
379,"(liquid gas) When discussing Apple, itâ€™s important to recognize a common pattern seen throughout industry history: companies that rely too heavily on the success of a single product risk complacency. Instead of actively innovating and responding to changing customer needs and new technologies, they may slow down and assume past achievements guarantee future dominance. Meanwhile, competitors continue to push boundaries with fresh products and services. If Apple does not maintain its innovation momentum, it could face challenges similar to those experienced by once-dominant companies that lost relevance over tim"
380,Cold fusion tv?  This is YouTube.
381,"Whatever it is, i am not buying another iphone. Atleast not the latest or thr first hand one. Its just not worth it"
382,All smoke and mirrors
383,"yeah, they released an update & the stabiliser went for a toss on my 12 mini 
another update & the loudspeaker stopped working 
This being my 4th iPhone, clearly the XR & 7 were  better phones."
384,Apple is way back in this AI race. ðŸ˜¢ they spiral into a deep den when the Vision Pro comes out.
385,"Privacy is still a concern for the users of tools like ChatGPT, especially when it comes to using personal data. If Apple doubles down on providing high quality on-device intelligence, I am sold."
386,Spent all R&D budget on Liquid Glass!
387,"I believe that since Apple was an underground and non business focused company, it never received defense contracts. Therefore it was never brought into later on projects that developed AI. Resulting in their slow output of AI"
388,"No offence, but this is clickbait shite. All software is compromised at some point in its cycle. And wow: Apple over-promised. Wow, that has never happened before, for any company."
389,Too many cooks with no head chef
390,"""RARE""??? ROTFL!!!!ðŸ˜…"
391,"I know Iâ€™m not the only one , but even if Apple ridge now in June 2025 was the best AI and actually delivered in their Apple Intelligence, I would NOT !!!! Use it anyway ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ but yes they did lied so now they have to pay the consequences and even with this huge failure I will still not buy an android device ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ I wish instead of this iOS 26 overhaul new Gl(ass) theme they would gives us a bigger battery across all iPhone 17 models , ditched the iPhone 17 air that no one asked for get back the 17 Plus, I just will rock my Jailbroken iPhone 14 Pro Max on iOS 16.1.1 using Dopamine Jailbreak and my iPhone 16 Pro Max on the current iOS 18.5"
392,"Apple: we wrote this journal that AI BAD.
Also Apple: look at our new invention, frutiger aero"
393,"This was bound to happen, apple got too greedy and cocky to the point where they add one feature a generation and call it a new iPhone!"
394,Steve rolling in his grave.
395,Artificial intelligence will never beat natural stupidity.
396,"Honestly Apple is so overrated and people boasting how ""premium"" it is. Literally other compaines are catching up or getting to the level as Apple"
397,"Gemini isn't that polished ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, not even close"
398,"The marketing department hasnâ€™t been talking to the engineering department, no wonder the head of software is â€˜shockedâ€™."
399,Apple needs another Steve Jobs.
400,Isnâ€™t it already predictable before last year?
401,"It's all spyware people, wake up..."
402,Can't innovate anymore my ASS
403,"Apple dropped the ball for a bag of cash long time ago... they arenâ€™t the â€œ think different â€œ company anymore, they are more like â€œ charge moreâ€ company"
404,"I got an iPhone 16 Pro as my first ever iPhone after using an Android phone (Sony for six years, Samsung for 8) since 2011, and I would say Apple has a great marketing team, that's all."
405,"Appleâ€™s product categories are starting to merge. 

iPadâ€™s software and hardware are becoming more powerful and some people will just get an iPad. 

MacOS visually appears to be preparing for touchscreens. Thereâ€™s more space between menu text and visual sliders. When Macâ€™s get touch screens, some people wonâ€™t buy iPads. 

Foldable iPhones may eat into iPad sales. 

If Apple TVs are continued to be upgraded, they will eventually be as powerful as current Mac Minis. Why couldnâ€™t Apple TVs (in the future) also run MacOS? 

It appears Apple sees this future coming. All new Apple devices use Appleâ€™s chips. This could be why Apple has taken a baby step of naming all new OSâ€™s with the same number. Eventually, Apple may merge some of its OSs. This could reduce development costs. 

At the same time, Apple knows it needs new products and/or services to sell."
406,"Apple gained sales by pushing privacy and then lost sales because privacy made it hard for Apple to deliver AI. 

The push for privacy has also cost advertising efficiency. This had flow on effects tooâ€¦ 

Reduced efficiency (and efficiency potential) hits a combination of profit, prices, wage growth.

More profit flows onto either more investment or more spending or reduced debt. 

Some niche businesses arenâ€™t viable without this efficiency (unlike a brand like Colgate who can market their toothpaste quite broadly)."
407,"Apple hardware has lagged behind Android options for years, and now their software does, as well. Ease of use (and social statusðŸ™„) was their main selling point, I thought. No more, apparently."
408,I still write and deploy Cobol on a 386. I am your master. Bow to me.
409,Artificial Intelligence planned by Natural Stupidity.
410,"Because modern apple is run by sales/marketing people, not product people. As Steve Jobs pointed out, when sales/marketing takes over, companies forget about the product."
411,4:00 that's hilarious. Google has already been automatically adding items to the calendar from emails for 10 years. I had to turn it off because it annoyed the crap out of me. Why is Apple just now trying to make that work? Oh right. They're always years behind.
412,I hate AI.
413,IOS 26 ugly design
414,"2:15 okay, that one sounds legit..."
415,I wish apple promised never to include all that ai junk to their phones
416,Hello
417,"The most innovative companies risk falling behind, they fail to adopt generative AI. Google has already established dominance in the space, while Appleâ€™s wait-and-see approach may be its biggest misstep in the AI race."
418,"We donâ€™t care ,they lied."
419,Thanks For This Video
420,"As a head of software and product manager myself, when a head of software is shocked about what his phone can actually do vs. what was promised, it is either one of the following:
- he is unfitting to the job, it is his main job to know exactly what the software is capable of, and, more importantly, what not 
- he is lying to cover up
- a mix of the above
Both variants are simply put unacceptable. Apple's board can sacrifice him as a pawn to move on, but the probability that they didn't know either is below 10%.

This is what we get when we blindly follow empty promises all along as Elon Musk is the undoubted king of unfulfilled promises getting rich of them showing others what is rewarded by society."
421,That Civil War: Apple comic is fascinating. Lol
422,#Crapple ðŸ™ˆ
423,9:40 Upgrades are for the weak. Lmao.ðŸ¤£
424,Johnie Ivy saw this earlier on. He was not happy with what was happening and where apple was going. He chose to leave.
425,"also with WWDC being pre-recorded presentation, gives Apple the luxury to pull a fast one on their easily persuaded cults-tomers. I get that it came from the time of 2020 lockdown, but it doesn't warrant the silent decision to make this way of presentation the norm.  SJ is probably rolling over his coffin"
426,"welcome to the new age of capitalism, where advertising is everything..... no company cares about quality anymore and word to mouth propaganda. Most people just believes and hopes on whatever they read online and want to believe in and that hope is what they pay for."
427,Elon would never let that happen. Heâ€™s always all gas no breaks
428,"Apple's new heads are repeating some of the biggest blunders in business & tech e.g. Nokia, Blackberry, etc.
Downplaying emerging trends? Refusing to adapt? They're committing a tech harakiri."
429,I think you undersold this video by making it about the AI Disaster part. It would've probably been better if the video was named something along the lines of The actions that led to the Disaster of Apple's AI. I didn't watch it before because I already knew it was bad but now I'm watching it I finalIy know how it came to be bad.
430,Apple hasn't been the same without Steve Jobs. Just like the Lakers haven't been the same since Dr. Buss died.
431,"I like how you say ""rare failure"" yet Apple fails all the time.. maybe you're an Apple user yourself so you say ""rare failure"" ... Apple WAS innovative long ago when Steve Jobs was alive.. once Tim Cook took over, he ruined Apple. Nowadays they're just.. pardon my language.. assholes. If anybody buys Apple today are just not smart people. Especially Mac users (considering expensive price)"
432,Apple cheated everyone who bought iPhone 16 this year. There is no fucking Apple AI inside!!!!!!!
433,This happens when a company is more interested in push diversity agenda than hiring the best people to garantee product quality.
434,And @9:16 dumb Siri stops this YouTube video as someone mention Siri.
435,"Steve Jobs was a great leader, living with the company, breathing, sleeping and waking up, not playing â€œletâ€™s try to look like Jobsâ€. The only thing these guys know is marketing only."
436,"It's a shame the ""tech influencers"" never call out Apple for this. And like Marques - mostly dance around the issue instead of being emphatic!  They are more worried about their personal access to the companies and freebies!
The ""smart consumer"" is seeing through this and is not letting Apple forget this or hide behind a new UI Interface. 
Glad there are people like yourself highlighting this issue and really going in depth!"

441,"Why are people so surprised? Steve Jobs IS Apple.

Remember what happened to the company when they fired Steve? They had to beg him to come back. Apple is just an uncohesive mess without him. Those who built the original Apple, are long gone."
442,seems like the CEO is not even around for all this to happen.
443,"Yeah I bought a Mac 4 Mini Pro for graphic design work, and i was excited about the Apple Intelligence.... then I was shocked at how bad it was."
444,Background music is genuinely so annoying and ill fitting that I couldn't watch.
445,"Apple went all-in on DEI and LGBT.  Those technologies didn't pan out, now Apple is doomed."
446,average people don't event understand what IA is.. but they use it every fkn day!
447,"I think it's also a good question to consider, when discussing the dangers of AI, that we take ourselvesâ€”with our highly intelligent brainsâ€”as a model and ask: why is it that most humans are not intent on destroying the Earth? The vast majority of people are peaceful by nature. Could it be that peacefulness is a natural byproduct of intelligence? The idea that AI would inevitably destroy everything is heavily influenced by Hollywood movies and is therefore not a rational or objective view."
448,They need to cut back on the number of H1b's.... the iOS keyboard is a hot mess.
449,"We need intelligent humans, not intelligent machines."
450,They've been boring and complacent since way before the AI debacle. They are coasting on their own success but it's not like there's another company taking that place
451,Wait till Apple buys a bunch of AI companies and they will be better then the competition!
452,"It's not a rare failure, it's just the first failure people couldn't make an excuse good enough to cover for them..., everyone including reviewers have always made excuses and covered for Apple."
453,AI Slop video
454,"Steve Jobs wasn't infallible. He thought fruit could cure cancer. On-brand for the CEO of Apple, but not great for life expectancy."
455,This is not the first time this has happened at Apple. This was the similar scenario that lead to Steve Jobs leaving Apple back in the day
456,"That is an awfully generous description ot the ""Apple Playbook"".  They have you so well trained lmao"
457,Apple is becoming New Nokia.
458,"the ios experience would improve 100X if they simply allowed users to uninstall siri. i can't tell you how many times siri has gotten in the way, fucked up what i'm doing, or impeded my progress. in no hyperbolic terms whatsoever, it has NEVER once done anything useful in my 10 years as an iphone user. but there's been thousands of times it pops up to ruin my experience. the worst part is, it keeps popping up and i don't know why. it's like, if i accidentally move my phone a certain way or push a certain combination of buttons... siri is gonna pop up and ruin everything. it disables all my controls and there's no way to get it to go away. you just have to sit there and wait like 6 seconds for it to disappear. i bet apple could add billions in brand value by getting rid of siri, but if they're too afraid to listen to user feedback, AT LEAST give us the option to uninstall it. it's garbage bloatware."
459,"How is that my mom is who a hospice nurse has to sign a non compete contract but these CEOâ€™s can help develop cutting edge tech at a competing company, and then immediately move to another company?"
460,"Iâ€™m done with Apple. Nothing really new, just more money for average products."
461,"What frustrates me is the fact that after knowing that AI wasnâ€™t ready, they decided to just released an unfinished product. 
This huge mishap wonâ€™t sway me to move to Samsung. 
They have their own problems too. AI is the next BIG thing and Apple decided to just brush it off? 

#FIRETIMCOOK"
462,song from the intro?
463,Idk man I am buying dips
464,"Hi, thank you :3"
465,"I think its interesting that apple was struggling with the ethical implications. The amount of data that needs to be scraped from the internet which is almost impossible to do without using copy written material. Iâ€™m one of the more anti-ai people, because of the stealing of content from creators (be it writers or artists) and could open them up to lawsuits."
466,"Start using pajeetware, quality decreases...
woah who could have expected it?"
467,"I agree that Apple flopped and falsely advertised; but I have to say, I am concerned about AI and how much access it has. If I can take pictures, use the maps, check email, etc, I donâ€™t need my phone to tie my shoes or tell me what to eat."
468,"what a load of crap, I'm actually glad Apple didn't embark in the scam that AI is and if at least one of these tech giants is more responsible than the others that jump in any ketamine induce fever dream a tech bro has."
469,Short answer... Apple sucks
470,Apple had two AI teams within it company and they still couldn't come up with s***
471,man I hate the background music! What's going on?

481,"The promise of AI is actual intelligence in a machine. I posit that until we understand what intelligence is and how it works (not just how it acts most of the time), we cannot duplicate it, only mimic it to a degree. Any danger comes not from homicidal robots but from applying AI as though it were real."
482,I had forgotten about that until WWDC 2025 and then I was like wait where are those features
483,"Donâ€™t worry apple stans, just wait a bit more until apple revolutionizes AI with features the competition had 5 years prior"
484,God donâ€™t like ugly. Apple stole everything from google android and now itâ€™s their payback.
485,I like the content of cold fusion but your voice is really unbearable
486,Okay but why is advertisements being pronounced like this
487,Longest video I've watched with full attention since the shorts-era and it was alarming.
488,"How is this happening? Simple, Apple  has always been a software company that never innovated, they took others ideas and pretended to be the creators and market better than others."
489,as an artist (i enjoy your music quite alot) i hope u rethink your use of AI images for videos and narrative imagery. those AI generated comics are truly awful and soulless..

496,Can't you say the same about Amazon and Alexa?
497,ground news is stupid. if u cant dissect bias from the context or publisher  then your opinion is jaded already.
498,"The fact you canâ€™t edit a photo with bare skin included without the AI blurring the edit area means itâ€™s not ready for release.  Wait until itâ€™s ready then put it out into the wild, Apple."
499,"If you think about the aborted projects apples been involved in (car, AR goggles, etc) its not actually that rare."
500,very good^^
501,Steve would have fired Tim EASILY with such FLAWS!!
502,Liquid glass. Is going to restore my faith.
503,"Apple can't ever compete with Google, because Apple is just a manufacturer whereas Google and Microsoft have a secure income source that they use to project"
504,They are not innovating but their annual revenue is all time high almost doubled in last 10 years thats growth and share holders and all the MBA's care only about that.
505,"Really, no one cares about AI, but yeah apple intelligence is a hot mess"
506,"Hot take; apple software has become buggy due to all the customisations that are offered now. There is a cost to customisability. 
Android has had these issues for years too."
507,"I just love when people talk about ""glitches"" all the time.. and in literally 100% of cases dont mean glitches but bugs. Generally speaking, if something is a software issue a developer can fix, it's a bug in 100% of cases. Glitches are extremely rare in this context, they are usually hardware related, and irreproducible. The artifacts caused by your GPU if you overclock it too much, that's a glitch. Any- and everything you do with software, games or whatnot, where the behavior is simply different from what you would expect, is almost always a bug. Essentially always if reproducible (but not all bugs are humanly reproducible, as networking or multithreading may be involved - tho given the exact same conditions, the same would happen)."
508,"Greedy YouTube milking this just for there personal gains, like who cares about apple intelligents or siri, cause if you are that one you're brainrot."
509,"Dead internet goes hand in hand with the AI.
We no longer live in a real reality, but an artificial one.
I hope all the world's governments will ban AI for good soon."
510,Why do Apple phones and Apple mouses have only button? It's because their users are too stupid for anything more complex than that.
511,Apple users don't need intelligence because they'd stop buying the products and Apple always make sure their customers remain dumb as a brick.
512,this aint gonna stop apple shills from buying
513,"Whenever I use the AI feature on my iPad, all it does is either tell me it's not available or ask if I want to Google. Essentially the same uselessness as Siri."

515,14:15 is that vrchatâ€™s home theme â¤
516,Apple is starting to fall the way of the nokia
517,So whatâ€™s next? Competitors will take over in a matter of years?
518,Next to watch: the fall of apple: what went wrong?
519,they want to do it right
520,Ai is a tough chapter for a company that is always late to the party.
521,"Siri was supposed to be Apple's AI dominiance 10 years ago.
Steve Jobs paid 200M to acquire Siri in 2010, which was a lot of money.
Steve saw the potential of Siri, not just a voice assistant, but the potential of AI.
And I remember people were playing with Siri when it came out in iPhone 4s and were astonished by it.
But actually Siri did not really evolve in the past 10 years. 
Apple just ruined another Steve's great work."
522,"The unfortunate thing is that us users, who pay top dollar for these devices, are the people who are suffering from this â€œin-fightingâ€."
523,Tucker Carlson claimed hwhat?! ðŸ˜‚
524,Since Tim Cook Apple has become mediocre
525,Tim Apple is rotten.
526,"2:16 thatâ€™s just the onion, thatâ€™s not an error LOL"
527,TIm can't cook
528,"Tim Cook needs to pull rank and whip the troops into shape. Apple, Disney.. All of these companies unraveling with no true visioneers at the helm."
529,Apple has sold the same over priced phone over and over for the last 5 years. Look we removed the headphone jack and now market that as a ground breaking sleek feature.
530,Everybody talking about ai but nobody talking about aslm pulling all the strings and really having all the control and power
531,"Craziest thing is Jony Ive teaming up with Sam Altman to create the world's first AI products. The first one being the AI companion. Something about as big as an iPod that travels with you and is ambient AI. Jony stated you'll need three products - your laptop, phone, and this device. It would have been the perfect thing for Apple to do. Steve would have tagged this 5 years ago as the next product. Ironic that Sam and Jony are doing this together, eh? Tim is a COO. The best tech companies in the future will be run by visionary techies (Jensen, Sam, Satya). So sad Apple has missed this train. ""Being patient"" is such gaslighting."
532,"I am so invested in the apple ecosystem and I love their hardware, it is a damn shame they are making them obsolete ðŸ˜¢ I really hope apple can turn things around. Tim Cook needs to go now before itâ€™s too late."
533,Apple sucks thanks to Tim Crook.
534,Let me guess.. the people that bought the 16 models for the AI wonâ€™t get it at all because it will get reserved for the new 17â€™s..
535,The AI Comic art looks wildly unprofessional...
536,The AI Comic art looks wildly unprofessional...
537,"Siri was trash since LAUNCH, if apple couldnâ€™t even handle Siri. Who expected them to handle ai lmao"
538,"As a planet we no longer need to be dominated by like a few companies, se need alot of fresh breath in like all tech industries."
539,Apple having internally redundant teams fighting for limited resources is the most Apple thing.
540,"It was evident that Apple is trash and kept eking out marginal upgrades and coming up with stupid products. 
I hate Apple because they are the reason why smartphones cost so much. Its a greedy company and it shows.
Looks we get to see Apples' Nokia moment."
541,Imagine if jobs was aroundâ€¦.
542,What happened to Apple? Steve Jobs died and with him went all the innovation. Apple basically was living from past successes and AI just show how far behind they had fallen.
543,Fancy video presentations not Steve on a stage
544,Please do a video about the false advertising on the refresh rate !!!!!!!  We are being throttled to 80hz 90 percent of the time. Apples variable refresh rate tech is soo bad !!!
545,"Youâ€™re acting like people suing big companies is evidence that Apple messed up. These are entirely different things. Are you that naÃ¯ve? Some lawyers are just trying to sue Apple for a money grab. At the same time, Apple software can suck. Silly goose."
546,"It I'm a senior VP at a $3 trillion company and I don't know that a major product that I'm in charge of isn't working until I try it myself on my phone; either I'm a lousy manager or the people work for me have been lying to me for a couple years, or both. Forget the technology that is just being a lousy boss."
547,"This is actually and extremely common pattern in tech. Apple is ruled by geriatric losers who can't keep up and uses their experience to bully and push out anyone who's actually capable, because those people are viewed as a threat to the ones in charge."
548,They have sucked since jobs died and Ives left
549,Jobs should have picked Scott Forstall as his replacement. Tim Cooke has been good for Apples bottom line but horrible for Apple customers.  He's not an innovator.  Jobs was.  Forstall was.
550,I hate how gen ai is being shoved down our throats
551,Apple is degrading!
552,"TBH, Apple still has a chance. But the clockâ€™s ticking.

The day a solid 30â€“40% of users start relying on well-polished AI features as a serious factor in choosing their phonesâ€”if Apple isnâ€™t ready by then, people will start switching. And thatâ€™s going to hurt.

The worst part? The iPhone is the hardest part of the Apple ecosystem to walk away from. Itâ€™s the anchor. But once thatâ€™s gone, itâ€™s only a matter of time before people want their laptop and tablet to also live in the same AI-first world. Thatâ€™s how the BlackBerry fall happenedâ€”slow at first, then all at once.

Itâ€™s wild because Apple has incredible chips. But they didnâ€™t build the GPU infrastructure. They didnâ€™t push the AI frontier the way they could have. They still can. But Microsoft saw it coming and doubled down on cloud + AI early. Apple chose not to.

If they donâ€™t turn the ship soon, this could be their biggest miss in decades."
553,More blinding white screens Dagogo...
554,Down with Apple
555,This is a bigggg boowomp moment for apple
556,Isn't all AI a failure ?
557,"AI is still vaporware 

LLMs are not thinking"
558,The CEO must go!
559,It's very apple-like to copy other people's technology and claim it as their own. They just hide it well until now
560,"Well, as you said, Apple is known for sitting back and waiting for others to work through the initial R&D before swooping in to polish it up. 

But Ai isnâ€™t something that they can afford to sit on. Things are moving too quickly. If they donâ€™t get on it during the early days of the tech, then theyâ€™re gonna be screwed"
561,I like the music man and understand theyâ€™re your compositions but itâ€™s a bit loud mate.
562,Greed destroys all. When profits become your main drive your demise is imminent
563,The beginning of the downfall of Apple.
564,Asian tech will always be far more advanced than US tech
565,Apple doing the Apple maps again.
566,School zone speeder getting still fame.
567,"I love how everyone is pretending that Apple is just now ""starting to overripen"" when (cr)Apple has been... ""not so good"" since at least those colourful CRT-G4 cubes came out in the late 90s/early 2000s. The ipod was just a fluke in terms of good quality (and even then, it was blown out by literally every single mp3-player in the same category that came out around that time when it came to audio quality and price/performance ratio).
Apple is, and has always been, good at one single thing: Marketing.

*Edit:* And since I forgot it, let me add my comments on the (first) iPhone: It launched without an app store, something everyone else already had. Nokia (Sybian), Linux (duh, they invented it) and even plain old JavaME capable phones all had some form of app-store. Except Apple of course."
568,Only reason I own an iPhone 12 Mini is that it came for free with a phone plan. I have never used Siri and never felt the need either.
569,Apple should be punished severely!
570,"Beside of software and tech one of the main selling point on asian market is prestige luxury brand sign of wealth in asian yourh population,but is not the same on eu and usa with the tech and software started lagged being sondoes the sale"
571,"90% of Apple Intelligence HAS shipped, and at WWDC they DID address that more personal Siri hadnâ€™t shipped."
572,"Apple can't spend billions of dollars.

OpenAi and Google are specifically AI companies and they've burned billions making AI

You can't just ""hire people"" and ""make an LLM""

It's too big. I think even for apple.

Apple needs to take an arrow to the knee, and focus on other things 

Having a partnership with Google would probably deliver stunning results.

Have other stuff to outcompete people."
573,time cook about to step down lmaoooo. this is like the 100th video on failed AI lmaoo
574,Apple should buy Anthropic.
575,lol @ Apple
576,I use Microsoft Copilot every day. It works well and they're always updating it.
577,"Things would be different if Steve Jobs were still here. That said, I think software isn't Apple's best strength. They make amazing hardware. Maybe one day we'll have iPhones powered by an Apple-forked version of Android. Just saying ðŸ˜…"
578,19:15
579,Sounds a awful lot like Nokia an their internal struggles with symbian and android
580,"So apple ðŸŽ intelligence showed there was none, they are living on legacy."
581,"Unfortunately, there was no equal available for Steve to hand his company to. Tim Cook was the best he had and we all knew deep down inside that he wasnâ€™t good enough. He was good enough to delay the implosion for so long, but he does not have the drive or vision that Steve had! If they cannot get themselves out of the box, they put themselves in, Apple will unfortunately become ordinary."
582,This is outrageous and I mean outrageous!!!!
583,This sounds a lot like Boeing.
584,"Por favor para una prÃ³xima entrega, podrÃ­as desactivar el doblaje automÃ¡tico, odio cuando los videos estÃ¡n en espaÃ±ol con voz de IA que no se escuchan naturales."
585,"This isn't something new. Apple has ALWAYS done this. I remember the first iOS release where Steve Jobs could not switch between screens and just played it off. Apple's software has never been ""polished"" or ""the best"". Thats what their consistent software updates were for. The reason Apple has the rep it has is due to fanboys and fangirls who wanted to pretend owning an Apple product meant they were special (or had money). Android has basically exposed their lack of innovation and creating useful products. Where do you think imposters like Elon Musk role outs mimick for his Tesla releases. Ijs"
586,When I upgrade my iPhone one of the first things I do is shut down Siri.  It has never made a compelling use case
587,Why does it sounds like what once happened in Nokia during Meego and Maemo OS development and came up with window phone...
588,Apple sin Steve jobs y Johnny Ives es simplemente una compaÃ±Ã­a de telÃ©fonos con mucha plata adentro.
589,"You can write a large book about the list of failed Apple products, the iPod saved the company"
590,The company is full of activists and DEI hires. This will get worse. Competence is no longer rewarded.
591,What apple did is exactly what the Theranos company did
592,11:50 to be fare that is how Apple originally became who they are under Steve Jobs
593,Apple just need to buy one of the AI company and integrate with its software..
594,"The iphone looks like an outdated windows phone os. Rise up, guys, and try a Samsung Galaxy â„¢"
595,"Honestly, from the latest presentation by Apple, who could say the Glassy look is actually innovative? Also who asked for it? ColdFusion is right - Apple has gone stale."
596,"Apple is big time DEI hiring. A bunch of ""touchy"" goofballs misguiding the ship. And who cares about ""liquid glass"" when they can't even get average AI going. Jobs would have bought Open AI before anyone had heard of it."
597,"I canâ€™t believe people are using a first developer beta as an example of buggy software. Of course itâ€™s buggy, thatâ€™s the point!
Using liquid glass as an example of buggy software in your video opening is not very convincing"
598,Apple really got 200 different perspectives going â€œSteve Jobs didnâ€™t die for this!â€ðŸ˜­
599,"Dagogo, Waiting for you to drop some more music over on Spotify!Great video as usual"
600,There is only one reason - Now Steve isn't on top of their heads trying to give the world the best experience.
601,im really disappointed you used MKBHD clips. that man is pure scum and I think you really need to rethink your approach.
602,"i don't want to brag, but if they would have given me an internship this mess could have been fixed."
603,diversity hiring
604,"When they started worrying about, forcing their customers to have a subscription for every single thing, that was a big sign of issues. Apple Music, Apple news, photos, iCloud, health for your watch, Apple TV, and the list can keep on going. So not only do you have to buy $1000 iPhone to use the majority of it features you have to fork out extra monthly subscription fee fees.  And then they want to get into TV doing their own TV shows movies, etc. Fail...."
605,Did Peter Molyneux start at Apple? That would explain the broken promises ðŸ˜‚.
606,a dropout ran the company better
607,A RARE failure? Apples walled garden is a gated prison. IOS is garbage now. Paying $1000 for a phone with fewer and worse features than an android from 10 years ago. Absolutely aweful corporation.
608,"4:55 Apple has always played a long game: they  wait to see how others flop or succeed then enter with a polished product that redefines the category.
Apple: releases Vision Pro"
609,"This whole thing is a microcosm of the current state of AI in general. The current AI programming architecture is much more limited than most people realize. There is no real intelligence to it. Rather it is just a fancy way of summarizing the internet. The features promised here are not possible with Large Language Models. No matter how much computing power companies throw at the problem. This is why we donâ€™t have self driving cars, in home robots, nor personal assistants. 

Our present AI architectures donâ€™t do the job and they canâ€™t. Weâ€™ll have to come up with something new. And it is unlikely that we will anytime soon."
610,"You would assume that a CEO of a company with more than 100.000 employees cannot really change its direction anymore, because there is just too much management between them and the development teams. Sitting thousands of miles apart, the teams will be disconnected from any C-level decisions and all that they can influence is work culture, ideology and logos, but they can't really control the products anymore. This is true for 99% of companies but Steve Jobs proved it wrong, he will be missed."
611,If Steve was still CEO they would have aced AI.
612,I guess the Appleâ€™s rotten right to the core.
613,"its very simple. Apple is copy cat. thats what they have done in hardware, apple store apps etc list is long but when it comes to doing something of their own, they suck. They wont be able to do anything in this sphere"
614,I love watching apple fail - long overdue.
615,"The loop is closing. 
Apple in 2025 is Nokia in 2007."
616,"From what I've seen, the software issues are only going to worsen with the release of iOS 26."
617,"Apple has been a joke since Steve died, and technically even before that. You all just thought you had something special. For years, Apple has been stealing and using others' ideas, such as Samsung & Google. Again, you all just chose to believe they are something special."
618,06:27 https://youtu.be/-vUK9uMn-lI?t=1h10m

620,From Boeing to Apple all US market leaders are crumbling apart. Woke virus has made once great companies now a joke.
621,"when accountants dominate an engineering projects = 0 ,  JG is no real AI person but a clueless ""tech AI manager"""

624,At the same time I don't need any of that ai crap running on my phone.
625,"I could care less about the new design â€¦ where are the promised features - that you are really want to use every day????

I really like my new MacBook â€¦ but except performance and batterie life â€¦ the tasks are the same which where made with my iMac late 2013â€¦"
626,"My experience with Siri is that almost everything I ask for, it cannot deliver. If I ask it to play a specific song from my playlist - especially if the song has a non-English name (so pretty much all of Schubert, Bach, Scarlatti, Monteverdi etc) and it will play some random modern pop song. It then reinforces itself, thinking that these songs are part of my music history and playlist. I listen to virtually no non-classical music, and none at all from the 21st Century, but 21st Century pop is all it ever finds. It will be funny if Apple cracks GenAI just as the bubble bursts :-)"
627,lots of bugs in apple ui these days and its getting glichy
628,Amazing and riveting to watch as per usual. Thank you mate. Also love the use of Monument Valley OST
629,"This is quite typical generation jump issue. Previous generation leader cannot adapt to the new for one reason or another and often quickly fades away. Like Kodak, or Nokia. 

It probably is also reason why in many â€œrichâ€ countries some infrastructure things are so ancient - like slow network connections while in â€œpoorâ€ countries might be installing fibre connections to homes as they donâ€™t have the old infra maintenance load to worry about."
630,Never bought an Apple product. I'm glad about that.
631,EU will most likely never have access to apple AI.
632,Do More With Less ...that is DeepSeek ðŸ˜Š
633,Apple without Steve Jobs
634,Apple is a hardware company with some software. Microsoft is a software company with some hardware. We can't expect both companies to be hardware and software experts. That's not how things work.
635,Did you forget Siri? It's not a rare failure.. we are tired of that narrative.
636,"I feel scammed. I only bought the 16 because of the features promised with Apple Intelligence. People are too brainwashed to call Apple out when they fail, thatâ€™s starting to change but itâ€™s still subtle. Majority of tech reviewers tend to act as if they work for Apple."
637,Apple needs to hire Peter Molyneux.  That'll do
638,"Apple has been playing cool for years on dwindling reputation. Colored text bubble, wtf childish bs."
639,"Apple is doing the SAME mistake what Nokia and Blackberry made. Not innovating quickly and eventually out of the race. 
But Apple has more resources to fast-track development. Let's see what happens in the next couple of years. 
I hope the Apple Sheeps actually wake up and think."
640,"Tim Cook has no vision, he fooled Steve Jobs and now itâ€™s obvious and too late"
641,"so apple died when their creator died?
same as spongebob direction? (that become aimless)"
642,"I think if Apple continues in this direction, they might end up similar to Nokiaâ€”not dead, but losing their iPhone and Watch sales. The smartphone market will likely be led by: Samsung, Nothing,Pixel"
643,The AI comic in the middle really threw me off. Looks weird and kind of cringe.
644,Just realized woke has made me hate rainbows
645,"Apple, especially iphone customers don't care about tech as much as we do. Apple can take their time, I don't believe the general Public sees what we techies see. Otherwise Apple wouldn't be on top of the smartphone shipments number (always battling Samsung)"
646,Samsung object eraser is soooo good. I use it to clean up my picture s all the time
647,"I can't wait for Disney to steam roll over AI generative tools with their lawsuit. Maybe that'll signal in the end of this nonsensical ""AI"" bubble we're all in."
648,"Couldnâ€™t help myself after seeing the â€žbuggyâ€œ software in this video..

What do people think when they install a beta version of a software, that theyâ€™re getting a full, working version? For those who donâ€™t know, to get beta software for Appleâ€˜s devices, you need to sign up for their Developer Program. Whatâ€™s that for? Then you already shouldnâ€™t post â€žbuggyâ€œ beta software and complain about it on social media!

To be honest, I am disappointed for â€žcomplaintsâ€œ like that be featured here. Your editors should know better. Highlighting complaints about beta software and making it seem like this is what everyoneâ€˜s getting is just sensationalizing a non-issue. Do complaints about beta software/apps from other companies get featured like this?

Yes, I know, this comment isnâ€™t about the topic of the video. I just think itâ€™s wrong to highlight whatâ€™s wrong with social media, with most people just never understanding things."
649,background music title please
650,The power of ai generated code
651,wait didn't Apple try to get into the EV market and fail spectacularly as well?
652,"Steve jobs who used multiple iphone's during the demo of the first iphone since they were not functioning fully, seeing all this.
SJ : Pathetic"
653,Its not just AI thats a disaster at Apple...
654,"The whole thing reminds me of Amazon Alexa. I've been using it since the first Echo generation, and I don't feel like anything has improved significantly since then. The difference between Alexa and Apple Intelligence, however, is that even Alexa's lamentable basic functions make it an integral and important part of my everyday life: alarm clock, timer, weather report, news, Spotify, and so on. And all the services that are important to me still work on the very first Echo generation! 

Sadly, I can't say the same about Siri. Personally, I find Siri unpleasant to use, especially when other people are around. As soon as I address Siri and don't immediately say the command, what feels like less than a second later, it replies with a rather cheeky ""Aha?"" as if to say, ""What are you bothering me with again?"". For one of the world's most valuable technology companies, it's a pitiful product.

Edit: I just asked Perplexity if there's a way to turn off this Siri behavior. The answer: ""You can set Siri to respond silently. Go to Settings > Siri & Search > Siri Responses and select 'Silent Responses.' This will prevent Siri from speaking unless you're driving or using headphones with the screen off."" I tried it and it didnâ€™t work. ðŸ™„"
655,2:28 Because they have always been a hardware company.
656,"You mean you can't advertise something, sell products based on that promise and then not deliver? Nvidia and Tesla better take note. rofl. We live in a broken world."
657,"they have just optimized and squeezed every last drop of value of the the products they had. It's like after Alexander the Great died, his empire was split between talented generals but they were not Alexander the Great."
658,"First of all Jobs died. He was the innovator in the flesh. Apples AI is all about Tim Cook. What does he do when he dont know shit about phones and AI. Well first, he just makes a ton of phones and make more of whats there. Do you see AI there? No, I thought so!"
659,Appleâ€™s only hope at this point is to bring Steve Jobs back to life
660,ðŸ¤¯ NOT APPLE COPYING THERANOS!!! ðŸ˜…
661,"Apple died with Steve Jobs, PERIOD."
662,Wdym rare failure? Apple is the very definition of failure.
663,Wdym rare failure? Apple is the very definition of failure.
664,That all makes Apple's the best GenAI around.
665,"Frankly, I am quite happy thereâ€™s not AI in my iPhone"
666,"Apple didnâ€™t take AI seriously, but then they turned around and tried to use it as a selling point for their most popular device of all time.  
They shouldâ€™ve just waited until it was ready and kept grinding in the background."

 lmaaao. theres no fxking way that guy could scam a billion dollar company. HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA full of bullshit"
669,Hate the instrumental at the beginning. Just two people talking over each other
670,Apple leadership NEEDS to change at this point. I think that they've completed their purpose for their era. It's time for someone new taking into consideration the new level of technology and future outlook for their sector to take the helm. They're played out at this point. The Apple Car= Nothing. Apple Intelligence= Nothing. Apple groundbreaking devices= Nothing. Apple Vision= Nothing. Apple...........................SMH
671,"tbh, apple has never had anything new for the past 15-20 years... every year they just upgrade the hardware, and nothing more"
672,Tim Cook more like Tim Cooked
673,"Is Apple AI as bad as Apple Maps was on launch, or worse?"
674,Apple spend most time for the presentation notes for the old product with new name.
675,Pardon the pun but - Apple pulling a Rabbit.
676,Not even U2s new album vould save this..
677,"Iâ€™d love to see Apple buy a large non-controlling interest in Anthropic and just pair up with them, as Microsoft have gone in with OpenAI. Apple is too far behind to catch up to everyone else with their own models."
678,"All this fall squarely on Tim Cook, he's the CEO. There are too many in Apple with old-school mindset, and all the new AI company's will soon be running circles around Apple. I don't see Apple catching up."
679,Grok is the goat
680,Apple has been and always will be trashed wrapped in pretty gift wrapping sold as an overpriced marketing product.
681,Apple's iPhone has been dead since the 5th version.
682,They thought they could market their way out of it even though they had nothing to show
683,"Everyone hating on Apple tells me I need to get the next IPhone, Apple is wise to take its time with AI, just wait and see! You can be first with AI, but how do you know you arenâ€™t first to make a mistake? AI is a mess! Right now! Apple knows better, but to each their own."
684,history is littered with the images of fallen giants.
685,"the simple fact that I cannot see the actual screen on i(Pad)OS devices when adjusting the screen brightness is something that frustrates me every single day. auto-brightness works fine most of the time, but not always."
686,This company only survives because there are too many people willing to waste more money in products do less than those that can be purchased from other suppliers at much lower price
687,Thanks!
688,Apple died with Steve Jobs. Weâ€™ve witnessed a decade of death twitches.
689,"Well, Apple is known for its slacked approach to innovation. They roll out at features that have existed for a at least a decade rebranded with some catchy title like Liquid Glass (has existed in Windows for 2 decades now).

Their forte is fashion, not technology. Hence, they are bound to fail the AI race."

695,"I switched to iphone about 8 years ago after being heavily anti-apple most my life before that.  With all this AI crap forced on me, I went back to android.  at least there I can turn it off"
696,Samsung Galaxy AI > Apple Intelligence
697,"I don't get it, isn't AI itself a disaster in general?"
698,"i think the most important thing about AI for mobile device is power. I think apple is developing an AI model that can run completely locally and in order to do that, they need to be develop an AI Model so efficient that their phone can last long with same battery"
699,A failure? Itâ€™s a disaster.!
700,"This is what happens when uninspired corporate leaders become the heads of companies. Steve Jobs was a visionary, a creative, connected to The Muse, whose inspiration and risk-taking took the company to sky heights. Now, every decision is made in a calculator. Every angle is assessed, with safety being the number one goal. It's flat, uninspired, and just plain boring."
701,"Sitting in the enterprise space of machine learning and large language models before the ai bubble, it's been incredible watching the amount of hackathons and roadmap work be poured into solutions with 0 proven value. I remember the head of product at a massive tech company telling me ""ai should be a little magical"" to which i responded ""if i wanted magic I'd go to Disney."""
702,"I think apple is losing direction generally, this week a few people have made videos about the downfall of their software quality also... And their machinery stagnates too, their hardware guys are still doing well though"

706,Whatâ€™s the music at the start of the video? Like at 2:00 minutes

712,"Well i still feel a company whoâ€™s been so right so many times couldnâ€™t go so wrong. Even though this yearâ€™s WWDC is BAD as well but they are on the right way! Appleâ€™s apple cuz of developers and app ecosystem and giving them the AI keys is a big step in the right direction and with all the wrongs theyâ€™d had, Iâ€™d still bet on them that when they get it right even iPhone 15(pros) will get the most bonkers features even though iphone 18-19 is when it happened(sadly 17 wonâ€™t be it but weâ€™ll see)"
713,Doesn't matter because the biggest cult of 21st century is Apple. Tesla was on track but failed.  The blind supporters of Apple are many. The crowd is crazy mad. Who needs products or AI.
714,"What people seem donâ€™t want to admit is that, the idea of Generative AI trends itself is a bad idea. I always said Apple never should following this trend, but they did, failure was inevitable. Iâ€™m still waiting to witness the day how it gets unsustainable, and whole â€œAI marketâ€ collapse due to it, move on to the next hype."
715,"Look Stevee Jobs is turning in his grave!  As soon as Tim Croooks saw that Siri started going downhill from the guy Steve left in charge, HE SHOULD Have took over and made sure Siri would be the newest thing of its time.  HE  blew it and continues to please the shareholders instead of the ppl that made them who they are!!! ALL OF US!!!!!  TIM you gotta go bro!!"
716,"Apple lost AI wars before they even started. Google were scared sh*less, scrambled and Gemini is now on top. That is the difference."
717,Blame DEI for Apple AI
718,Apple used to outsource Siri and other proprietary tech
719,"They finally hit the wall that comes with their business model. inevitably, there's a point where you can't just wait for somebody else to invent a technology and then you swoop in and find ways to mass market that in your own branding. We all knew it was gonna happen eventually for Apple."
720,What is the song in the beginning?
721,Apple's design overhaul is also a massive failure at the present time
722,"Lol you are such a grifter, if users want AI they install the apps..."
723,Siri is still the greatest missed opportunity for Ai voice. Itâ€™s still just so basic and shit
724,Siri is still the greatest missed opportunity for Ai voice. Itâ€™s still just so basic and shit

728,"Gemini is a piece of shit. Not trying to downplay Apple's monumental failure here, but let's not pretend Google's shit don't stink."
729,"Mentioned ""half-baked"" features that were added, probably only were added, to prevent these lawsuits, or at the very least give their lawyers something to work with."
730,"I think you got this all wrong. 
They call it the ""Apple Intelligence"" and that's exactly what you get. 
Nothing. Zero. Nitte."
731,The new iOS underlines the failure since it looks absolutely horrible
732,"All this fat has made them slow and stupid.
The introduction of Windows Vista on a phone is not helping either."
733,"You took developer beta 1 of iOS26, dug out worst looking screenshots and put it forward as ""evidence"" in the first 50 seconds of the video. Why watch further?"
734,IMO is the apple mentality is its worst enemy. cannot be  clsed environment and look for global awareness.
735,Apple lost the AI race. They are as innovative as Gucci. But they can still win the race against AI and double-down on privacy and security. Leave the actual AI to apps from other companies but give users even stronger control over what those apps can access from their information.
736,"All AI is a breach/thief of privacy and copyright laws, you just don't know it yet and are too excited. Apple is being the sentinel of security that it always has been. Only time will tell why Apple hesitated and these other companies rushed. Samsung blew up phones in your pocket once. 
The tech is in its infancy to be too sure of anything."
737,"If you don't own an iPhone, you are not gay. ðŸ¤¡ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
738,"At this point, why doesnâ€™t Apple just make a bid to buy ChatGPT or buy a major steak in the company"
739,"Appleâ€™s downfall started the moment they thought of involving the Indians in manufacturing. Intel, Dell, MS, Google and so many others failed to surprise the world with new innovations the moment they either hired Indians in top management positions or in manufacturing. Itâ€™s like these people are jinxs AF!"
740,"Apple is beginning to lose steam. No AI, no revolutionary products, Vision Pro failure..."
741,Apple announces their new head of product development: Elizabeth Holmes
742,That MKBHD's demo of Gemini Live is absolutely sick!!
743,This is amazing because this video was published 2 days ago and when Joanna Stern interviewed Craig from Apple he was smiling and it turned into a frown when she brought up Apple Intelligence lol
744,Apple is getting worse and worse with every year. Nothing really changed from iPhone 8â€¦..pathetic.
745,Apple needs to stop focusing on woke shit and focus more on properly developing their products.
746,GREED. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s killing Apple. Only reason many people still use apple iPhones is because of iMessage.
747,That apple ripening joke made me start spewing gibberish ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
748,"""for once"", lmao remember when Apple was about ""people"" because I sure don't. Corpos will be corpos."
749,"Chatgpt is not a solution for everything, but very useful for certain things, as long as you know about its limitations"
750,"Look at your putting developer, not even beta build screenshots in your montage criticizing their software. Trash."
751,"Bro, I knew Apple was cooked when they had no response for a foldable phone. Foldables are old tech now and Apple still hasn't caught up. I can only imagine the security and software nightmare on the backend of making a foldable for iOS systems. Their software is security tight, but too much so. It's like a closed loop system which makes everything secure and harder to hack into, but limits innovation and the ability to come out with new tech."
752,The said change in UI is from the era of Windows Vista ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
753,Apple is the next Nokia :P
754,"I dont think Apple is behind on anything. I feel like this is the â€œugly phaseâ€ of it, a part of the plan. *Tinfoil hat on* AI on the iPhone is not their priority right now. They see it as more of a gimmick than useful. I think theyre leaning towards Apple Vision. Hot take, Siri will be rebranded to something else."
755,"Tim Cook is a great operations guy but he lacks the sort of vision needed to make great leaps. He made Apple super profitable after Steve Jobs by making the company super operationally efficient, but I get the feeling that he's not the person you need in the captain's seat when there's a revolutionary new technology to work on. Steve Jobs - despite all his personal and professional failings - could give that sort of firm direction to the company and get everybody in line towards a common technological goal."
756,Vista scoffs at apple glass
757,"Its not about technology anymore, its about sw qnd leadership. Apple chips and devices are more than capable of utilizing ai, just leadership wants fancy design and support lgbt instead of delivering whats promised"
758,"instead of improving, just published a paper how current ai sucks at solving puzzles."
759,Apple HAS been FAILING for OVER a DECADE...
760,Cook needs to step down.
761,The same could be said for Tesla...
762,frutiger aero aero incoming
763,Corporate failure by parasitic bureaucracy and counter productive woke ideology is the norm these days not the rarity.
764,"Not surprised. They have an internal culture of arrogance, not interested in other points of view. Coming from someone who's interviewed with them multiple times."
765,Apple has been going downhill ever since the death of Steve Jobs.
766,Anyone else is tired of the whole AI thing? Apple messing up their AI is a positive in my opinion. It is getting increasingly more difficult to find new devices that are not primarily a screen for AI apps for someone who does not care about the whole trend.
767,Apple DIED when Jobs did...No soul...No vision...just profits!
768,Siri has always been a gimmick to me. Iâ€™ve had every generation of iPhone since the original. Iâ€™ve maybe asked Siri to name a song five times and I think it was only able to do it once. Never asked Siri to do anything else.
769,"Well analysed, they basically missed the boat with Siri by turning it first into what Google Assistant or Alexa became and after that most importantly by adding AI to it.
Intead of that they took TOO BIG of a bite which they couldnâ€™t chew in developing Apple car or Vision Pro headset, which doesnâ€™t sell.
Siri & AI should be their no.1 priority from the beginning even before Chat GPT came to the market.
They made mistakes and miscalculated AIs potentialâ€¦"
770,a.i = Alibaba intelligence
771,"Ai is still disappointing. Its basically a glorified google search. Apple has passed its peak. Let the decline begin. No head phone jack, no chargers, no ai functionality."
772,"Never had mush respect for Tim Cook. I mean, really, you think Steve Jobs would have allowed iPhone releases where the big new thing was a range of device colors??? (ugly colors at that)
Actually, maybe. But Tim Cook did."

778,2 trillion dollars screaming in the corner
779,"Very few are able to admit the truth: Steve Jobs is to blame for this and other failures. His model of running company is what is flawed. Its about putting total control and power into hands of technologically incompetent marketing people, like Jobs himself. While it was all about products, this was doable. But when everything transfers to services and things that do not have outward physical appearance these people show their true faces."
780,Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos fame tried to become the next Steve Jobs.  Now it looks like Tim Cook is trying to become the next Elizabeth Holmes.
781,"Putain, votre VF IA est insupportable !"
782,"When are people gonna realize that the expectations set by the AI industry and advocates will never be met.

786,It's because they couldn't steal ideas from China after Trump's tarrifs ðŸ˜…
787,Is it just me or is it only the investors that are actually demanding AI? I have no interest and turn off the already minimal features Apple offers.
788,you say it is not very apple-like to borrow tech from other companies. what about Xerox and the mouse?
789,"Sometimes Iâ€™m astounded on how wrong Siri can hear me lmfao 

I feel like Iâ€™m talking to an automated call center."
790,Google is going to come out with a highly polished phone with incredible lenses and functions completely with the phone â€¦.  Oh wait â€¦.
791,"Apple is in the same position as blackberry was dominating the market, since steve jobs died it is now run by accountants and infighting departments, no leadership or vision, the beginning of the endof a once great company.
The software is as bad as microsoft now, all full of bugs and apps which do not work properly.
R.I.P. Apple.ðŸ˜’"
792,"Do people think apple is really cutting edge still?  Sure there was ipod and iphone, but then there was apple maps.  And OMG I just tried gemini live with camera recognition and it's amazing."
793,"That new OS looks like crap, who finds that compelling or used friendly?"
794,"isheep don't care about AI and we have seen them cheering for windows vista style, calculator in iPad, changing folder color so they will do just fine because of people locked in the ecosystem."
795,Definitely buying an Oppo instead of an iPhone this year
796,"Think of the Roman Empire. It was ruled by emperors, but fell when the one without clothes assumed the throne. I really wonder how come Mr. Cook is still the emperor."
797,Why was I unsubscribed from your channel?
798,Can pixel overtake Iphones?
799,"wait for me apple i'll bring back the glory you have , i just need the hardware to build a better app"
800,"Apple doesn't always refine the tech. For example, they didn't refine the bezeless phones. The mix 1 was far ahead in terms of build and design than the iphone 7/8 and iphone X. The XPS series were far ahead in terms of design and even upgradability than macbooks. So much so, by the time apple started to go more bezeless, dell started to make the XPS series worse and worse. Apple has never had good cooling prior to the M chips, so much so, windows laptops with more powerhungry parts and similar weight/size had far better cooling systems. Namely gaming laptops. With ryzen 4000, they even started to beat intel versions of macbooks in terms of battery life."
801,Apple ist the Nokia of 2025.
802,Leave Apple alone!
803,Apple Intelligence's notification summary for the Onion looks about right.
804,"Apple has to go down now.. itâ€™s been a long time that Apple stopped the world of inventions on the gadgets that we hold.. all the engineers of the world are working for 1 thing. Smartphone..

We should really let other people build smartphones other Than Apple/Samsung. They shouldnâ€™t  be the biggest always.. companies Like LG, HTC died, bcz of the duopoly.. it shouldnâ€™t happen .."
805,"Cook is a bean counter manager. Heâ€™s not a visionary like jobs.
It raises the eternal question can a company survive its founderâ€™s death.
There are many  examples of companies that eventually went wrong once the founder and their vision were gone. I think thatâ€™s what weâ€™re seeing here.
That being said, I recently tried a Samsung phone and tablet and the experience both in terms of how smooth it is and the visual aspect are still superior on the Apple platform .
Android looks like a bad cartoon drawn on the back of a cocktail napkin"
806,Apple is next nokia
807,"Same thing happening in GoogleIO. They fake everything, they don't release anything they show."
808,"Apple want to do it completely on device end to end encrypted and they want to keep customer data private thatâ€™s why they are falling behind while others are collecting users data and and using those data to train their AI model ,Apple is trying to do something completely different while keeping users data private I think generative AI is not possible like that way"
809,Steve Jobs would have thrown most of this in the fish tank.
810,"Yes, my iPhone need to be restarted a couple of times in recent months, just yesterday, the wallet wouldn't come up after I press side button twice."
811,"Solution is simple, Apple needs a new leadership! Itâ€™s time for a newer vision."
812,"Solution is simple, Apple needs a new leadership! Itâ€™s time for a newer vision."
813,"Solution is simple, Apple needs a new leadership! Itâ€™s time for a newer vision."
814,Sounds like when Microsoft missed the smartphone era.
815,overly dramatic music* at least for the first song
816,"Isn't this story similar to Elon Musk's promise of ""full self driving"" and ""robo taxis""?  Why isn't there a class action law suit against that fraudster Nazi?  He promised things that aren't being delivered and has now even admitted that the current hardware in Tesla cars will never be capable of full self drive despite publicly stating that it was coming soon.  Sounds very similar to Theranos to me.  Yet one CEO is in jail and the other is playing god with a country's infrastructure."
817,"AI is still not that important, Apple still have time to catch up , with all the money they can easily acquired and promising AI start up"
818,Apple Unintelligence
819,"Steve would focus on revitalising the Mac if he was here today. The current design is so old, colourless and boring. Even with the newest look. Itâ€™s looked like it could be easily broken or stolen for so long. The design minimisation has to stop. Itâ€™s time for a more premium revision with more weight and better specs."
820,"I feel like Apple became a cashcow since Jobs died. No vision, no innovation just higher prices for products."
821,Never knew Iâ€™d say this but Apple might end up like Nokia or Blackberry
822,"But what strikes me is that, this company with such shattered history and open idiocy still manages to sell millions of phones every year. The consumers have become mindless robots just buying into the fad giving money only to be told 'soon' for something which others do offer now. Truly dystopian times !!"
823,"As I watch this, my iPhone keeps crashing YouTube"
824,Apple's downfall is just following  the U.S downfall.
825,Crapple.
826,"Apple is the best when it comes to BS-ing consumers, especially when overpromising, overvaluing their products and services. Them being the best working software in the smartphone world has been over since around 2018. It is only a matter of time if they won't willing to change pace, they will be outcompeted by others in every way, Siri was never the best assistant in the first place and now it is even worse"
827,it is a sign of Apple's decline. Steve Jobs was a marketing genius but even he was not a legit engineer or computer scientist who can truly understand LLM. So that's Apple's identity after Jobs death -- a marketing company.
828,TIM COOK  cooked Apple
829,"Luke  Miani, the apple sheep with no subjects anymore"
830,Siri is basically worthless at this point other than making calls or text to someone.
831,How can one of the richest companies in the world not implement AI in their OS while it is available even in open source.
832,Apple supplies tech products to people who are not good with technology. Nothing impressive about it.
833,"Steve Jobs was no stranger to infighting at Apple, but he was able to make the final decision."
834,Maybe they have to stop the new iphone release this year until Apple delivers what they promised last year..
835,"I think it's
Apple's Nokia moment

long way going down"
836,What is the song at the very start of this video? I remember hearing it in a playlist
837,"Apple as a company might be in the same situation where many other very successful companies have been in the past. At the complacency stage where the company thinks that it is at the top of the world in its chosen field of business and that no one can touch it. This also happened to companies like Kodak, IBM, Nokia and so on."
838,The ONE good thing that came out of Apple Intelligence is Apple finally bumping up their base model Macs to 16gb RAM.
839,"Is it possible that this is a play by Apple ? This has always been their play, polish up janky systems or Protoss products into a polished products. Apple has been great at this, now they are plying the long game again on a very large scale.  Maybe, just maybe we are on the verge of one of apples biggest surprises to date."
840,"to be fair at the times that Apple does use AI it is actually good uses, like the information button is the gallery"
841,"not sure whats wrong with my whatsapp, i have to restart my phone every now and then"
842,Well at least apple is not using our personal data to train their AI
843,"Less Innovations, More on Marketing. They are definitely left behind."
844,"~3.5 mins of unnecessary intro, before the real content of the video begins at 3:36! 
Not impressed ðŸ‘Ž
It's a pity because the video itself is well made and informative, but c'mon already and get to the point!"
845,I feel like they have cornered themself!
846,"It is clear that Apple needs to buy a number of companies in the AI hardware and software and robotics industry. 
It's time to put those 100's of billions to work.  There is no use in having a massive cashpile if you end up bankrupt because you sat on the sidelines doing nothing.
Or merge with a vertically integrated company or strategic JV .
JV with Google and Tesla would put them back in the games like yesterday. Apple can build an Apple car using Tesla platform cars and just add the Apple design and software on top. With a Google JV, Apple could  use their AI models and server farms.

It will cost Apple a lot but not as much as starting from scratch."
847,Steve Jobs wasnâ€™t scared to cannibalise products. The current senior leadership team are and itâ€™s Appleâ€™s biggest downfall.
848,The clueless and visionless corporate folk at Apple fell victim to AI hype and FOMO. Jobs would have never allowed this.
849,we want only 1 AI feature and that is: AI Photo and Video Detection (when you scroll your instagram feed or tiktok feed we need to know if we watch AI or real video) we dont need other AI garbage features
850,What is the song in the intro? Itâ€™s wonderful
851,"Apple become too confident on the strategy that soly based on the market where it take atleast 1 year to get a mainstream upgrade.

This simply does not work at all in a space where everyone growing rapidly every single week"
852,We should not need AI for everything. The more AI there is the less we are living and thinking for ourselves.
853,But my question is do we really need advanced AI to the mobile?
854,"Hopefully people start to realize that Apple has never been good at creating software. They just buy stuff from start ups and other companies and give it a polished look. ""AI"" is mostly crap all over the globe, as far as I can see it's pretty much a scam or a gimmick. So of course apple can't deliver a good product because they can't buy anything that already works because nothing works."
855,Siri is garbage
856,"If you hire , managers instead of technologists, your tech company becomes a mgmt company"
857,"Management being over ambitious. Dev teams struggling with stable system, at same time the scope was revised plagued the Apple"
858,"Itâ€™s time for Cook to go. Apple has been so stagnant since the passing of Jobs. All there is now is wow look this iPhone has a slightly larger screen, slightly better camera. 

What happened to innovation?"
859,"I don't need ai to use my phone. I use ai for other things but not to ""use"" for phone things."
860,Apple has been falling behind for years. They have them innovative and at least 10 years.
861,"Galaxy AI is already pretty much polished, utility orientet ande deeply rooted all over the UI.
Apple here fell far behind.
Only USP for apple is video recording consistency on quality, rest in every other dimension, its loosing far behind"
862,They think they re too big and have stagnated thats just it
863,Tim Cook is in the clouds.
864,DEI
865,I would never call Apple Intelligence a failure. It finally made them put 16GB of ram on their base models. Complete win in my book.
866,There should be Section 288 consequences for Apple ðŸ˜¡.
867,I'm surprised Apple remains on top of the most valuable company despite having incompetent leaders.
868,I'm surprised Apple remains on top of the most valuable company despite having incompetent leaders.
869,Apple has been using and building machine learning into the OS way before AI became a buzz world. What do you mean
870,"If your definition of AI is just a glorified chatbot, then Siri did fail. But if you count all the other Apple Intelligence enhancements that are practically useful or that most people donâ€™t even realize theyâ€™re already using, then Apple (more than any other company) has done the best job for consumers. Apple has been doing this with ML-powered features for ages now, long before AI became an Nvidia hype train to drive up stock prices."
871,Apple No Intelligence
872,"Interestingly Google was also caught off guard by OpenAI, but have been able to respond and get back up strongly when it comes to AI. I think Apple plays it way too safe most of the time. When one of the biggest reasons to use an iPhone is to be able to use imessage a piece of software, that could be ported, then you know Apple really don't have anything truly compelling anymore."
873,I do believe Apple has been on a slow downwards trajectory since Steve died.
874,Not a rare failure but a common theme in past 5 years
875,"6:31 This is a really really bad comparison. 

Google cannot do this on-device. Especially Multi-modal. 
Infact, no one knows how to run a SLM which is multimodal locally. 
Install the Edge AI model library from Google and you'll see, how bad Gemini Nano and Flash are at function calling. 

I think this video shows ColdFusion's lack of understanding of the AI model architectures."
876,"Apple and Windows both employ tons of H-1Bs. They just got sued for $25m for preferring them over Americans.
Anyway, have fun with that."
877,Apple will soon buy deepseek and make a comeback ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°
878,7:55 Man AI art is uglyðŸ¤¢
879,"Apple spent $10B to remove â€œHey.â€
Google made an AI that roasts your outfit in real time.
We are not the same."
880,This calms me as an Apple user because I am a private guy and I care about privacy. All this says is me that Google and Samsung made millions of photos about people and their surroundings to learn their AI. And Apple couldn't as easy or perfect as their competitors because they care about privacy. It's shocking how good Googles and Samsungs AI is. It makes me afraid a bit.
881,This what happens when companies value the investors more than their own.
882,15:28 Iâ€™m pretty sure they said 2026
883,The music is very loud
884,Thatâ€™s so un-Karl Farbman-like haha
885,"The level of cope over Apple calling out LLMs multiple failures as a useful tool is palpable all over YouTube. Whilst they are no longer the ""it just works company"" they consider that a valid goal and appear to hold to that.
This means they are happy to selll smoke and mirrors but for Apple it needs to be smoke and mirrors they control, thats what FOSS and Free Software advocates hate. But it also means they wont engage in immature tech, that's what Microbros and Cryptobros hate."
886,Don't forget Musk robo taxi from more than 12 years ago? Your cars are supposed to run auto taxi when you're asleep. Here we are some 12-15 years later..
887,"I think apple are far behind the competition, as they have only made very small improvements (if you call it that?) & relied on the apple users to be loyal n can't leave the eco system  due to them spending so much money on it,  they are stuck in the walled garden, apple have sat back for so long with the money coming in, they didn't advance in technology like other competitors have n now they are panicking & rushing things to catch up but playing catch up is making things worse as they try n if it fails they fake it in the wwdc  n hope they can fix it while they try n sort it out b4 being rolled out...but they fail. The public buy on their promises & now people are losing patience n going elsewhere where, if they don't improve they may be fined big time for false promises & and lose investors & that in turn lose the what once loyalty of apple buyers"
888,"If it will be Running on the devices, I am willing to wait a little longer. I am sticking to Apple! I can use these Chat Bots all I want anyways via Browser or the App. And as usefull as it might be, I donâ€™t find AI that important personally. But for Business customers it could be much more important"
889,Face it. Steve should've fired everyone! and brought back Johny Ive. Most sold and popular Apple devices were literally designed by Jonny Ive.
890,What happened to Apple is very simple. Steve Jobs died. RIP Steve.
891,"No Steve Jobs, No Innovation"
892,The new Nokia
893,The rounded corners in the thumb is hilarious. ðŸ˜‚
894,Let's not forget it'll only work on the latest models.
895,"I'm sorry but the statement ""borrowing someone else's tools..... not very apple like"" is clearly wrong.  That is exactly what apple is built on.  They have always borrowed others tools... just made them better."
896,"AI is overrated, never used it on both android nor iphone."
897,Every empire is bound to crumble at any point in time
898,"Apple is a company that is too big to fail, has massive ubiquity, and has a market share with the iPhone that guarantees its success, and itâ€™s not terribly interested in software anymore unless itâ€™s things like emojis that get its core audience excited. Basically, itâ€™s become a lifestyle brand that doesnâ€™t have to blow the doors down anymore, which is a shame for us older users who remember the Steve Jobs years."
899,"Nowadays you'll find it very hard to come up with a non fanboy reason to actually buy an iPhone. The only thing Apple does better is integration with it's other products (massive selling point). Android has come a very long way and having used both IOS and Android systems side by side in the not so distant past (iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro max, Apple watch SE 1 and 2, Samsung S22 Ultra and S24 Ultra, Galaxy watch 5 pro and Galaxy watch 6) i have enough knowledge to conclude that overall the Android operating system is better and more flexible in general. I did find however that the Apple watch integrated extremely well with the iPhone and was a bit more seamless and smoother in general."
900,1:10 the reason why i didnt buy iphone 16 promax
901,It was because of Jews? Wasn't it??
902,We don't AI honestly
903,"I saw Apple market â€˜Knowledge Navigatorâ€™ and wanted one then, and I am still waiting. The depth of seriousness is eminence, this - AI as THE agent between User and Device - is the path to smart home, smart car, smart life, subscription services. WWDC 25 feels lost and loathsome."
904,Apple has been left in the dust such a shame to what they once were. Far better products and software elsewhere.
905,What> Apple have strings of failure as they refuse to invest at a lost in it for the long term. It's not rare....
906,Tim Cook is cooking Appl ðŸ¤£
907,"I'm tired of you getting things wrong. Before was Steve Jobs,. Although it might seem you are right about the strategy, the smartphones of the time were nothing like today. The genius of Steve Jobs was making an UI that a 3 or 4 year old can use intuitively, without even knowing the alphabet. This is genius and neccessary. Personally I also don't like Appl anymore but I give credit where it is due."
908,"Ni idea de todo eso, serÃ¡ porque no nos enteramos de dichas promesas"
909,Apple Lame-I am I right? Guys? Guysâ€¦ guys ðŸ˜©
910,"My thought exactly, ""well they already got Siri, making an improvement ain't that difficult than making it from a scratch"". 

TIL, Siri is introduced by Steve Jobs, and everything is making sense why there's minimal ""improvement"" in apple products, especially in their AI slop"
911,Apple had never been great without Steve Jobs .....
912,The glowing edge was literally copied Samsung regular notifications.
913,"18 months later if the IPHONE still doesn't have a capable AI, it WILL become a paper weight and Apple stocks are 50% off."
914,"never wanted apple intelligence, face id, aux removal, home button removal, pretty much everything apple has done after iphone 8 plus."
915,"""We're the biggest company in the World and have nothing to show for it"""
916,"Also, WWDC25 spent a lot of time hyping the ""Liquid Glass"" UI, which actually is around very 2005-ish, about 20 years ago, with Apple's Aqua (which looked great on the Macs and IPads of the time) and Microsoft's Aero UI  (which looked great on Windows Vista).   Also, Liquid Glass has problems with lack of contrast (as your video generously demonstrates).  Apple (literally) lost it's sheen with Jony Ive's ""flat"" look around iOS7 and OS X 10.9 Mavericks."
917,They might as well just adopt Gemini
918,This narrator has more AI than apple
919,"Yet somehow, Apple diehards STILL think Apple are synonymous with innovation. Innovation my ass, they're behind in every way by 3 to 5 years and the UI is hard to use; more steps to do what Android does in 1 or 2 steps."
920,new product or feature -> live event
921,Funny thing is apple doesnâ€™t give a f***
922,"To be fair, this is why, in the past, Apple limited new features. You can't have it both ways, clearly. Apple wants long term support for every new product or feature they release. They don't want to leave their users high and dry. We all know which company does that..."
923,There is NOTHING that shareholders won't screw up in their obsession for more roi.
924,This will become Nokia 2.0 all over again if they dont do something about it.
925,profits > products
926,Itâ€™s like Apple hired some Samsung thinkers
927,They wouldâ€™ve been better off just waiting and making something that was mind blowing as an AI than rushing it.
928,"It's almost like Apple, Nvidia and Intel are charging crazy prices for tech products that aren't any better and often worse than ones that already exist."
929,"This is what happens when you run out of ideas. I say this with all sincerity, I don't understand how some people are practically captured in that ecosystem, which is always behind the competition. And Apple needs to think seriously about the future, because it bases its profit far too much on a single product whose popularity is declining and which It has been capped in terms of innovation."
930,Wow.. as a hardcore Apple fan I've been watching their ecosystem going downhill every year!
931,Siri is good for setting up the alarm.
932,"I donâ€™t actually care that Apple doesnâ€™t have decent â€œAIâ€ yet. But I care that they overpromised on something - again - when they had no marketable product, and still donâ€™t a year later. Underpromise, overdeliver. Not promise everything, then deliver nothing. Unless you count bolting ChatGPT onto it. They called the race far, far too early."
933,"Jobs designed the headquarters specifically to encourage collaboration and to remove knowledge silos, because it was killing Apple to be fragmented in different directions and conflicting projects. Itâ€™s actually sad to see theyâ€™ve found a way to regress anyway."
934,worst control center panel design i ever seen 0:41
935,Apple is becoming the next Nokia
936,"We think apple don't want to invest too much on AI because the investment was way too expensive just to be used on apple products alone. They need to sell the AI to other company. But since apple would be very closed and highly moderated that would be not viable. So they will just wait for other well polished AI, maybe with all their scheme to force buy them by manipulating the market, something they're very best at."
937,Steve Jobs would have refreshed the incompetent line-up multiple times by now. His ways were not pretty.
938,15 years ago everyone was so sure apple would lead in ai race ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸
939,"I really don't care about Apple Intelligence itself as I'm pretty AI-skeptical, but as a major Apple user I am definitely worried about the long term implications. Apple is no saint, but in a world of unscrupulous, downright unethical Big Tech companies, I have more faith in them than most."
940,"CF: How did Apple end up fumbling the single biggest tech shift in recent history?
Answer: Easy. Apple lost their visionary - Steve Jobs.
Tim Cook(ed) is the new John Sculley of Apple."
941,"I like how ""MKBHD"" is actually one syllable more than saying his full name"
942,"Siri simply sucks. I only bother with it in my car because, while driving, I have to go hands free. Between ambient noise and whatever is going on in Siri, it often screws up. My most recent luck with it was getting it to play music that I wanted. It's the first time Siri actually worked. At the same time, it couldn't get me directions.

Naturally I don't want Apple Intelligence to be using my personal data in its training models. Not if that can leak my data. Data I keep in Apple's iCloud is something I want to be as private as data I've got stored locally."
943,"I still see no value in AI.
to me it's like recycling paper, do you want that paper as food containers for you Deliveries?"
944,"I knew I should have gotten a samsung phone. Been using iPhone 16 for a few months now, and Iâ€™m regretting my decision."
945,They brought back 100+B of stock but no money for compute lmao
946,"When 1st Siri came out it seemed way steps ahead but stood stuck there. Then Shortcuts, Intent API came but still wasn't good enough. Now it's still dumb. Steve should've got operated and lived to make Apple AI leader. He would have."
947,Extremely disappointed to see the video open with highly misleading screenshots of â€œbad softwareâ€ which are taken from a PRE-BETA that has been in the hands of only developers for less than a week.
948,"The problem with Apple is theyâ€™re like any other tech company these days. 15 years ago under Jobs, Apple was clearly run by mostly designers and engineers. Now itâ€™s clearly run by sales and marketing teams. Which is a real shame."
949,""" I can't believe I am going back to Facebook""- Anonymous"
950,"The fact that ChatGPT can transcribe my voice to better accuracy, than Siri can understand me. SHITS THE FUCK OUT OF ME"
951,"It's Apple, i really don't care.."
952,Apple failed before when they fired Steve Jobs. Well heâ€™s gone now too and look how itâ€™s turning out just like it did before. He was Apple. These executives will never get it
953,Life is good when greedy tech companies like Apple struggle. They could cut their prices by 50% and still be more expensive than many of their competitors.
954,Steve Jobsâ€™ clone(s) bout to be deployed guys.
955,"Meanwhile, Israel is starving thousands of people in Palestine, and has cut off the internet and communication so that the world does not know about the atrocities they are committing."
956,"This is not a Disaster it is called strategic innovation and they didn't pull it off. I and I am sure they will come back with something better than the best. Unless Elon decides to go full AI. Regardless, Apple innovates and dominates markets. A mistake comes yes, but strategic innovation calls for it or else we wouldn't have nuclear missiles. An oxymoron, I know but an inevitable one. Silence is the absence of sound, but it can be so loud that it is heard."
957,Apple ignores product issues being discussed in Web Forums. Merely addressing most common issues people are complaining about would be a big step forward.
958,Apple usersðŸ˜‚
959,"Oh my globe, Apple has turned into Kodak. Stock price soon to be zero."
960,Brilliant in depth look into what's wrong with Apple thanks ColdFusion ðŸ‘
961,Rare??!! Do you have any idea how much they fail? They had to be bailed out of bankruptcy because of all their failures
962,I think itâ€™s time to get Elizabeth Holmes out of prison and put all the other CEOs in there. Politicians your next.
963,"As Iâ€™m watching this on my iPad, it started to glitch. Itâ€™s been working fine all day like click on this video."
964,"Thanks Dagogo, I didn't know about all that."
965,Another overrated American company
966,All of those people who say they hate AI and don't want it can now go and buy an iPhone.  ðŸ˜…
967,"2:05 Watch out, the paparazzi is coming for you."
968,"As someone whoâ€™s a HUGE Apple fan and dedicated his career towards their platform I canâ€™t believe how much they keep dropping the ball. 

IMO Tim Cook needs to go or step asides and stick to what heâ€™s good at, scaling. 

The vision is mostly gone but I still have hope"
969,The audio is done badly by an A.I. and the cuts are badly done by an A.I. and the bot voice is thin and slow. This is unwatchable.
970,Steve rolling in his grave. RIP Steve
971,"Iâ€™m glad like it seems like they are getting off their assess because they are getting sued left and right, then this glaring AI failure has brought some hard truths to the company."
972,Just like Nokia... They soon will fall ðŸ˜‚
973,Blackberry all over again
974,Apple is shit
975,i can't even RESIZE or simple DELETE the widgets in my ipadOS 18.5.... ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
976,Is it a coincidence that Apple have now released a research paper saying that AI reasoning models aren't as good as people think they are?
977,"Next video, apple liquid glass ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
978,You forgot about apple releasing papers that discredit LLMs
979,Apple's fall from grace. Sad to see. Happens with every major company eventually.
980,Can't believe there are some people in the comments who believe that Apple will bring out the first polished AI. The technology advances too fast.  The only chance Apple will have is to buy themselves into an existing AI. They are probably already talking money with these companies.
981,Coldfusion at this point just creating entertaining videos instead of quality and journalistic videos
982,Their monopoly couldn't save them this time
983,It's giving... Elizabeth Holmes.
984,What is the use case of ai in smartphones?
985,"1:04 Why apple is getting sued and Elon Musk gets a free pass. So apple didn't delivered Apple AI, so what? let's compare with Elon Musk

Tesla Roadster announced in 2017, with preorder price of 100k or how much it was, now in 2025, is not ready yet
Tesla Semi, again in 2017 not ready yet, also faked tests with the prototype.
Full self driving announce in 2016, with ""we can do it now"" about 10 years later, there is no full self driving, but people paid for it, also the tests for it was faked.
Colonies Mars by 2024
Robo taxi? postponed
Tesla bot, late again
CyberTruck was less of a car for much more money and was postponed 2 years

Imagine buying shares in Tesla with Elon's promises that were never delivered, so again, why he gets a free pass and Apple gest sued?"
986,Whatever Apple did to the audio editing feature in iOS iMovie is criminal. They destroyed it and made editing audio on an iPad a total nightmare.   Everything else is normal: the same program with no improvements or added features for years and years.
987,wish they would open up facetime and imessage so I can I swtch over to pixel lol

I understand most people would like to have children and some can't. 
But what's the latest big hype about artificial insemination about!?!?ðŸ¤¯"
999,Apple is just UI company?!!
1000,Apple definitely made a big mistake by not buying Anthropic
1001,"I guess it depends, it is hard for me to see how much AI is actually used by the general public. I myself played a lot with image and video generation, and I see it being a powerful tool there, LLMs can be also impressive in some cases, however all these are me goofing around, and thus I would not say it has much value for me, other than maybe some entertainment from playing with them.

At work I lead a small team who builds complex 3D mapping software (including stuff like 3D rendering - custom engine, physics simulation, AR/VR, training machine vision AI models etc.). This week I was adding OpenXR support to our engine, also helped out some colleagues on our cloud rendering based web front-end, looked into issues with WebRTC, needed to programmatically turn off gamepad input in a windowed UI depending on current task, and fought some weird issues with MSBuild (Microsoft's build toolset).

During these 5 major problems I asked AI. I was elaborate, so I gave it multiple tries since I already spent hours researching the topic. From these 5 problems, in 4 cases the AI told me solutions repeatedly which were entirely wrong (e.g. used hallucinated APIs, provided entirely false or very outdated answers), and when I pointed this out and tried to nudge it for a better answer it flat out said that what I am looking to do is impossible. I think my job safety is great, as I managed to achieve all these 4 ""impossible"" tasks, and none of them were hacks, the AI was just wrong. The in the fifth case it provided also wrong answers, but its wrong answer showed an API which lead me to a part of the documentation where I later found the bits I constructed the working solution from.

A new colleague uses AI a lot, and turns in bad PRs. I spoke with him and it turns out it is as AI recalls wrong and outdated answers, and instead suggests or at least leads the guy to bad and hacky solutions. This is because the good solutions are not documented well, or at all, or the wrong / outdated solution is overrepresented, or old answers state that X is not possible, which was true in 2007 but not anymore.

So what I am saying is that in my case for example I do not benefit much from AI. The best usecase it gives me is when I need to work with a new programming language, as it knows the basics fine. But after the initial period it is not very useful for me.

I think it is possible, that many who are in charge at Apple might also work with complex stuff, and fail to see the benefit of AI. Despite it having benefits if you know much less or have simple questions. On bright side it seems my job is quite safe for now."
1002,by the time Apple gets everything corrected. itâ€™ll probably be the best AI on the market. we seen them do this before. late to the play but wins the game at the end
1003,Apple's Siri is so gay. I am looking for a very good Android phone right now. Which one should I get? I must use Gemini and other A.I agents.
1004,"Whoa he spoke to me directly!! I listen on Spotify (his voice is just amazing for chilling and getting hi like hello) 
I'm now going to include this moment in my resume. It will read:

Spoke to Dagogo Altraide. The REAL one, not an imposter. Yes, the Dagogo your thinking about right now"" 

Im gonna get such a high level job in tech. Thanks dude ðŸ˜Ž"
1005,Apple been trash since steve jobs died
1006,"LLM is useful, but what people are claiming it is at the moment is absurd.

And when will we know it's truly sentient?"
1007,Steve Jobs is turning in his grave.
1008,"The video used of a guy in a data center holding an Apple keyboard like a tablet that is somehow linked to the servers is hilarious.  We have actual tablets and phone, who fake it with an Apple keyboard on an Apple video? LOL"
1009,"Their statement is not wrong about what AI is at the moment. Question is when, will it not still be that and when will we know?"
1010,we don't want AI cartoons
1011,Tim Cook was too busy virtue signaling for years until he realized he needed to change his tune. Too late
1012,when I hear Apple - I hear 'murica
1013,"Imo, Apple is a product company, not a research company. AI requires lot of continuous research, that's why Apple fails in this field."
1014,Don't worry we are adding a marginally better camera and hiking the price by $500!!! Apples iPhone for the last 10 years
1015,"I think this is a 'lose the battle win the war' kind of situation. Apple's strategy to go for small on-device AI features instead of just streaming everything to a big server in a datacenter is not yet paying off. But who's AI is paying off right now? The peak of what AI can do is very interesting, but also very expensive. A lot of the cutting edge features require 200$ a month pro subscriptions, but I expect 95% of people yearning for AI features not willing to pay even 20$ in a subscription. The whole industry is a house of cards and if/when it collapses you are better off at the bottom of it."
1016,@coldfusion did you use AI to create these comic books?
1017,"4:46 And borrowed someone else's stuff, not very apple like

1023,Apples Nokia moment?
1024,Apple the next Kodak
1025,"Without Steve Jobs, Apple will become mediocre with expensive prices."
1026,"Having a competing division in the same company isn't uncommon in silicon valley but from what I've read that's not exactly what happened in this scenario. It was more one executive distrusting another and acting out their own deranged form of corporate sabotage by literally sapping resources from the original project purely because he saw the new guy as stepping on and taking part of his territory so to speak by getting his own AI division outside his sphere of influence. All this stemmed from the fact that he couldn't fire him as he was a ""star hire"" so it would make apple look stupid if they were hired and fired quickly because one executive/employee disagreed with their vision."
1027,"I would rather have a product without any AI functionality than with, especially if it has telemetry"
1028,"Wasn't Apple was always about competing teams? It was the point of their innovation back then. Handling the idea to different teams, make them competitive to handle out the best project. In this narrative sounds like these internal competitions never existed, until the AI popped. Which is a lie."

1032,"I've sworn off Apple products since around 2015 or so, but one of my jobs bought me an M2 MacBook Air to mostly get on the same software as everyone else. Immediately there's a ton of weird software shit I gotta deal with such as the computer throwing a fit whenever I try to open a file someone sends me. ""we can't verify it so we're putting it in the trash for you and you gotta dig around in the settings to get it back."" Also whenever I have an external display plugged in to the laptop and close the laptop before unplugging the display cable (easy to do) the menu bar freaks out and I have to restart the entire computer to access the menu bar again. That's just like the most common bullshit, but everything about the iOS experience has been frustrating and terrible.
I don't understand why people say others prefer Apple due to their products ""just working"" or whatever because this damn macbook keeps fighting against me when I'm just trying to do basic shit like open a music file or video someone emailed to me."
1033,"But isn't the usual business strategy - sell non-existing products and services - see if there is a market for them at all, if there is, let engineers figure out how to make the advertising scam a reality."
1034,"Apple ""Intelligence"" ðŸ˜"
1035,It's not that Apple's AI doesn't work. Other AI doesn't work either. But Apple dared to stop pretending it ever will.
1036,"Yo ColdFusion, why are you talking about tech in a 1080p crummy video?

1037,It happens when you get away with selling the same thing every year with little to no innovation
1038,Does anyone remember Apple's ridiculous VR glasses?
1039,Stealing I mean borrowing something from another is Apple like
1040,"I think Apple should stick to their high quality standards and DON'T rush into releasing half baked LLM AI stuff, that doesn't really work that well, just because everyone else has been doing it. ChatGPT, Copilot and Gemini are useful for some cases, like summarizing text or detecting patterns in images. But they are definitely not the all round personal assistant that their marketing teams advertise them as. Copilot will generate you a cooking recipe with lethally toxic ingredients. ChatGPT will generate travel plans that only work if you have teleportation available as a mode of transport and Gemini will generate an instruction manual for a device, by just mashing together multiple totally different device's user manuals. Ohh and all three tend to just make up fantasy stuff if they don't know an answer to your question.
At the current mid 2025 stage, I see this technology (AI natural language prompts and chats) as mostly a helper to Googling. Because they are indeed faster to find keywords than you are as a human. But they also make more mistakes than you, as a human :)

More specialized use cases do work really really well though. One of the few Apple Intelligence features already released to EU customers, is the pattern recognition feature for the iPhone gallery app. If I take a photo of a leaf, an insect, a landmark etc. it will give me a subtle button to determine what it is that I have just photographed. And this feature does work. It's not bleeding edge technology anymore. But it's polished."
1041,"I'm sorry, but you made me laugh out loud while at work listening to you say @ 4:44 ""not only did apple arrive late, it showed up empty handed and borrowed someone else's tools, not very apple like."" 

That is literally their whole thing.  They introduce features years after the competition, and call it ""revolutionary.""   This is exactly how apple has always operated."
1042,We should stop pretending intelligence exists on this planet.

1044,There has never been a reason to use apple.

1091,"It's so hard to automate app testing on iPhone, so many restrictions and BS. There's no way they're gonna get AI to automate anything for the customer."
1092,"The key move is to get in early, with Alaxio token you can do that"
1093,Just stumbled upon something wild in the AI + DeFi spaceâ€¦ search â€œAlaxioâ€ and see for yourself.
1094,Presale is over halfway sold and theyâ€™re barely doing big marketing yet. That tells me serious investors are already loading up in Alaxio.
1095,"Apple is a disfuncional company, but at least they have diversity!"
1096,"MKBHDâ€™s words stand true to this day, â€˜Never buy a product on the promise of future updatesâ€™ and that applies to everything and unsurprisingly to Apple"
1097,Alaxio might be the only presale Iâ€™ve joined this year. It just checks all the right boxes.
1098,Alaxio is gearing up to be the next big thing in DeFi! I'm already in the presaleâ€”are you? The early bird gets the best gains!
1099,I passed on a few solid presales last year. Iâ€™m not making that mistake with Alaxio.
1100,"If youâ€™re looking for your first crypto investment, Alaxio looks like a excellent starting point."
1101,You can chase green candles all dayâ€¦ or get in before the chart even forms. Thatâ€™s Alaxio ALX right now.
1102,"Iâ€™ve seen too many people regret not acting early. Alaxio ALX is in the perfect storm: AI, DeFi, low cap, and now rumors that big crypto influencers (like Jake Paulâ€™s circle) are looking into it. Once it hits TikTok or Twitter in full force, itâ€™s game over. Get in now or watch from the sidelines."
1103,"Next stop for Alaxio ALX, Binance listing."
1104,"The key move is to get in early, with Alaxio token you can do that"
1105,"Ride the bull run with Alaxio, sale ends soon"
1106,Oxymoron: Apple Intelligence.
1107,"is Apple Intelligence that bad? Actually, I've been using AI functions and they're quite handy and has helped me a lot."
1108,"As soon as Steve Jobs passed away, Apple became mediocre...the management are just overpaid greedy bureaucrats and beancounters now. Apple will eventually become the Boeing of the computer world...Steve Jobs must be rolling in his grave..."
1109,"I reckon Tim Cook is trying to emulate Elon Musk, that guy is a professional at not delivering on his promises and ended up the richest man on Earth."
1110,"""shaving millisecond off saying hey siri is very important"" "" nothing else is important"""
1111,"This is not just happening with apple but all products, lower quality, higher prices, more marketing. Reason, rapid depreciation of the currency you buy all those things with."
1112,yeah Apple products are rip off products. You are being decided by them!
1113,this will take to the first iphone with android
1114,This video was hard to watch with my iPhone nearby
1115,"I'm embarrassed that you used ""Make Apple Great Again"" in what appears to be obvious AI generated comic book. Disappointing..."
1116,"This is a perfect example of what happens when the Marketing people are favoured over Engineers!! 
Steve HIMSELF TALKED ABOUT THIS DECADES AGO!!!
Typical starting phase of the downfall of a titan....."
1117,Steve jobs would definitely not wanna live to see this kind of Apple. It's embarrassing.
1118,"Today's 'Hi' was quite weird, felt like an artificial crackle in the voice. I hope you're not using AI, a clarification would be appreciated."
1119,"THIS IS WHAT LLAILA AFRIKA WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID THEY ARE NOT AS SMART AS WE THINK THEY ARE. THIS IS THE WOLF PACK BEHAVIOUR HE PROFOUNDLY SPOKE ABOUT AND WE THINK THEY ARE THE BEST, THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE FIGHTING AMONGST THEMSELVES AND TEARING EACH OTHER DOWN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. WE NEED TO KNOW OUR CULTURE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEIRS. THIS WHOLE TECHNOLOGY IS BUILT ON UNDERSTANDING OUR BODY, MELANIN. WE DONT SEEM TO GET IT THROUGH OUR HEAD THAT WE NEED TO SEPARATE AND BUILD OUR OWN MELANIN SOCIETY, OUR OWN SCHOOLS WHERE OUR CHILDREN CAN GET A PROPER EDUCATION. IF WE DONT UNDERSTAND THIS IN 2025, I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO REALLY SAY BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS BLATANTLY OBVIOUS WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER."
1120,Apple AI is still rubbish . Their AI  photo deleting features is  really bad .That features is basic but yet apple still mess it up
1121,that's what people say when Apple released Maps. Give them a break seriously.
1122,"Unless Apple sorts out the suited 'glory boys' from it's technicians,it seems unlikely that Apple AI will ever become a reliable product...particularly Siri. Pull your pants up Apple !"
1123,What a shame for Apple ðŸ˜¢ I've been using iPhones for almost a decade and this is just really bad news for Apple ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
1124,Every day I see Ai becoming more and more useless
1125,Apple should buy Adobe... their AI image capabilities are amazing.
1126,0:14 anyone know the song name? Thanks!
1127,"My desktop Mac Minis have been pestering me for months to upgrade to Sequoia with Apple Intelligence in it, and I'm just not doing it. I don't want this AI crap on my Macs or any of my devices. I don't understand it, I don't trust it, and they really don't seem to have their act together on it at all. This video just confirms all my mistrust of it. No telling how much of my 3rd party stuff that new OS would break, and I""m not taking the chance."
1128,Marketing doesn't work with AI. So apple lost its big advantage. Lying marketing and brainwashing.
1129,"I don't understand... Federici was skeptical about AI but then went on and demo'd stuff that didn't exist, breaking Apple precdent?"
1130,Letâ€™s all be happy that at least one company didnâ€™t fall for it yet.
1131,Whatâ€™s the best alternative phone then?
1132,"AI in this current form is just another bullshit silicone valley attempt to milk more money. Itâ€™s hilariously stupid. 

Apple AI is barely a workable state and does literally nothing. Useless"
1133,Why is AI shoved into every product? I want an iphone -- without any AI in it. No one asked for it and it never worked. Why is this now impossible to find?
1134,8:08
1135,"With failure thereâ€™s always something good that comes out of it. This is a moment where the cultural, ethical, moral, and technological standings will need to be reevaluated and challenged internally and externally. I believe Apple has the resources and ability to overcome this. Itâ€™s a wake up call for sure and Iâ€™m happy I watched your video. I was aware of a lot of the things that were happening and this just adds more context and awareness to whatâ€™s actually happening.

Google and Meta jumped really fast at the AI revolution but how ethical is it and how accurate is it with retrieving data? Where is it sourcing its information. I will admit that I have a base level understanding of AI. Maybe you can put out another video if you havenâ€™t done so already, explaining AI to those who are not as familiar with the inner workings of it."
1136,"I agree with most of the points but itâ€™s still important to remember at 0:38 the only currently available form of iOS 26 is:
- A â€œpreview,â€ not even a beta
- For developers, not end users
- Not shipping for another 3 months"
1137,"Bought my 1st iphone last month to experience why apple is so famous. The latest iphone 16pro.
The OS literally s*cks!
Simple features of Android are missing in iphone. Lots of bugs and limited options at literally every place.
Cannot find name by typing contact alphabet on number keypad.
Multiple attempts to bring saved media visible in gallary.
Have very limited widgets.
automatically starts wifi, internet, bluetooth during midnight because those buttons are only stopping new network search and not actual wifi, internet and BT.
Cannot erase single alphabet of typed word. Have to erase whole typed word to change one desired alphabet.
Apple map is useless.
No fingerprint protection.
Camera settings are not available in camera but deep inside phone settings which are difficult to remember.
Regretting my decision of leaving Android!"
1138,Always love your video. â¤â¤â¤
1139,I think apple lost the race and wonâ€™t ever be able to catch up. This is how titans collapse.
1140,11:06 It called my Siri hahaha
1141,This video will be banned in the US.. americans can't comprehend that there is anything better than Apple
1142,No steve jobs. Not working.
1143,"I hate to tell you but your so completely wrong about this. 

Apples costumers value privacy, security, and ease of use. You absolutely cannot provide customers on device generative ai at any affordable cost. This is because of the unpresidented amount of dedicated cloud storage it would require to keep customers interactions with their on device chatbot secure and private. And that's in the most basic terms. The storage space for that amount of data would be well over a terabyte after probably 20 questions or tasks!! Plus the consumer would need to train the chatbot on their own. People dont want to do that! They want a chatbot pretrained, and ready to go! To provide that, Apple would be forced to partner with a company already doing that. A company that's been traing their chatbot from the limited amounts of free internet content. Content thats not copy written, not trademarked and content you dont have to pay for.  The same company will also have the servers dedicated to keep the conversation transcripts of peoples conversations with the chatbot for future training of said chatbot. We are talking shitloads of data space! Personally I don't think we have the infrastructure to even come close to housing it offline. It'll all be stored online, and it will out data any and all quality content on the internet. 

To Apple this is a privacy and security nightmare! And rightfully so! I'm proud of apple for thinking in these next step terms. They do it because they want to make a profit first but they also do it because they want to get tech right, the first time. Unlike Microsoft  with literal shit software, constant security patches,  constant attacks, and numerous dataleaks.  Who even knows who has access to those chatbot transcripts? Who can read them? Who are they being sold to? No one fucking knows! Thats not a good selling point for Apple, or fundamentally any company. PLUS, in order to have a chatbot via a third party youll need a constant internet connection. Which is also a privacy and security threat. 

Apple isnt lagging behind. They are trying to prepare for the AGI immersive future experice that will render ai chatbots on the same level with fm radio. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… Apple isnt in the business of risk, its in the business of furture tech."
1144,Newsflash: Apple was NEVER good.
1145,"14:02 My dude, are you gonna grab something with those tweezers or just hover them around?"
1146,Rare?
1147,Aren't there any companies with AI know how they could acquire?
1148,"Alternately, you could market the no AI aspect as a feature instead of a bug.
Personally I don't need no stinking AI intruding on my personal space.
As an app fine, but not integrated into every aspect of my device."
1149,"Alternately, you could market the no AI aspect as a feature instead of a bug.
Personally I don't need no stinking AI intruding on my personal space.

1150,AI should be illegal.
1151,Why am I getting Nokia vibes from apple?
1152,The funny thing is... you can apply the same complain to pretty much all of AI hype.
1153,"One things for sure, a lot of the current lot would have been sacked if Steve were still around."
1154,Agreeâ€¦apple intelligence is lagging by generations
1155,Apple AI-the best reason to switch to a Galaxy S25 Ultra.
1156,*has begun
1157,Slacking ðŸ˜‚
1158,"Greed... as usual, imagine how stuck up the *** a company must be to have hundred of billions in the bank and tens of billions in yearly profit using old GPUs and not investing in one of the most revolutionary techs in the history of all humanity."
1159,I donâ€™t want Apple or anyone else pulling data out of my email and planning my day or week.
1160,"I have always been an android user, just this year after hearing so much about apple products, in January, I decided to give apple a try and went all in with iPhone 16 pro max, MacBook Pro m4, Apple Watch Ultra 2. Only to realise now apple is behind everyone."
1161,what are you talking about?? everything apple is trash.
1162,"It's not only the software they are fumbling with. It's also the hardware. They keep making mistakes and making their phones undesirable because of missing features or price. I was waiting 5 years to jump from iPhone SE 2020 to a newer ""budget"" iPhone that would feature Ultra Wide Band (UWB) functionality with U1/U2 chip. Even iPhone 16e still did not have this feature. I was forced to get iPhone 16 and I don't like it. It was more expensive, it's too big and its camera sucks compared to what I am used to on a single-camera iPhone. I can't easily take close up shots anymore. This will likely be my final iPhone."
1163,Its not rare to see apple failing. In the recent years most things did by apple are kind of failure
1164,"Watching this, it just reminded me of the story about Xerox seeing a computer mouse for the first time and completely dismissing it."
1165,"16:25 ""A way to detract from their glaring failure""
Even the Glassy Design is the most obvious glaring failure"
1166,Apple AI: Apple All Indians
1167,Apple is done
1168,It can't be a failure if they are still going to do it.
1169,Siri is the OG AI feature and Apple should have focused on this instead of playing catch up with its new AI product
1170,Their behind for ages in competition. Isheeps just can't believe it
1171,"""a rare failure"" .. lol, apple fan boy made that headline, they obviously have not researched apple enough"
1172,Was this video written by AI?
1173,"There's no denying that Apple is not having its best days, but it's not the chaos that some are preaching. I've been an Android user for a long time and I recently got to test iOS. The first thing you notice is that something seems to be missing, especially for Galaxy users, but you also realize that the device simply works and that it will last for a long time. iOS allows you to install preliminary and therefore unstable versions for testing, and these grotesque bugs are probably due to this scenario.

As for AI, they promised a lot and didn't deliver anything. Their mistake was not admitting that it wasn't their focus and not trying to integrate ChatGPT from the beginning. Google also went into crisis when ChatGPT was launched, but as a company focused exclusively on software and with the largest database in the world, it didn't take long to recover."
1174,"Wall street overlords have a rotting spell, every company they predate upon suffers enshitiization.  A touch of Hades, a stench fromthe hell of greed. Boeing, Enron, Adobe, Apple,. Which one will be next?"
1175,Music in the background is loud. Reduce it
1176,Their mission is to sell their products at a highest possible price.
1177,apple intel really feels like apple maps all over again but this time instead they just slowly stopped talking about it
1178,"After Steve Jobs gone, there's no Apple"
1179,"After Steve Jobs gone, there's no Apple"
1180,"i'm a huge apple fan, but since steve jobs dead apple lost his vibes and quality"
1181,Well I'm really afraid that apple shouldn't meet the same fate as that of Nokia and blackberry where they were too late to adapt to the recent trends. I am seriously still vouching for apple that they will pull up from this.
1182,this is what happens when AI is the biggest economic bubble ever lol
1183,"4:19 how could he be shocked?? as head of software was he not actively involved in something as ""ground breaking "" as Apple Intelligence?? it would suggest he wasn't actrively involved...."
1184,"4:19 how could he be shocked?? as head of software was he not actively involved in something as ""ground breaking "" as Apple Intelligence?? it would suggest he wasn't actrively involved...."
1185,I have a friend that used to work for the localization team of the evaluating part of apple intelligence (hint it was outsourced) and the lack of direction and lack of direction and communication between Apple and the team he was in was insane
1186,"All AI is VERY bad.... ChatGPT, Grok, Apple, they all suck.  All they did was scrape the internet for training data and then becomes a silly and bad search tool. It picks up all kinds of garbage including trash from Reddit. It is all trash."
1187,Bing gets  no noticeable mention? that's what I use instead if Siri on my iPhone 16pro Trash ass max
1188,"From what I have been told ( friend of a friend of a friend of a friend that works in the apple canteen), it is more a case of ""dont invest time and money in Siri, there is a ""secret AI project"" that will soon replace it."
1189,The next hooli !! ðŸ˜‚
1190,Apple floundered with their EV car and here too? Color me shocked
1191,Apple seem to be living proof that intelligence is artificial.
1192,2:14 That's a headline from The Onion... the satirical website
1193,Apple has always been overrated. No real innovation for years
1194,am i the only one that thinks Apple should have been dissolved when Jobs kicked the bucket? he was the only reason Apple did anything right. now look at them ðŸ¤­ðŸ«µðŸ¤£
1195,Company with 1 trillion in the bank and no idea how to use it.
1196,"Man, everytimgs the series Silicon Valley showed about big execs is coming to light. It was a documentary!"
1197,"8:42 oh wow, they turned out to be right and they could have just skipped all this"
1198,"7:18 wow amazingly useful, thank you google for spending billions and illegally training on our data to produce whatever this is"
1199,Nvidia is hype. Apple is hype. Google is hype. Microsoft has this one in the bag.
1200,oh nooo they are not making money on AI slop like they though they will.... a tragedy...
1201,I DON'T WANT ai on my phone. We don't need it. It's a waste of massive resources around the World. Its making people stupid by letting it do thier thinking at work etc. the apple ai failing is good.
1202,"I think it was a mistake to go beyond Siri in the first place. There are way more important topics in the world. How about designing a  programming tool for little or huge games on the Iphone and Ipad? How about designing a literal Sandbox for Appple Vision? How about an age related functionality that can be adjusted by the parents? That helps pupils step by step to get to solutions rather than filling in the result. With rewards along the way that make children love it.That all could use specialized AI in the background to make it magic. What they sold was the generalistic positronic brain that tries to replace humans while it is struggling to reason on the same level as a 2 year old toddler. No benefit, no reliablility, does not help organize or enjoy your life. What a waste."
1203,Did Apple base their new OS design on Windows Vista?
1204,Apple decided that they'll let app devs finish their AI with releasing the language model
1205,all propitiatory software is destined be buggy
1206,rare failure? like the apple vision pro?
1207,"Iâ€™m okay with Apple just making simple yet reliable hard and software integration. 

I donâ€™t give any fuck about AI."
1208,Apple is the new Nokia. And not in a good way.
1209,I fired Siri a while ago and hired Alexa. Siriâ€™s response; â€œThatâ€™s not very nice.â€
1210,Apple died when Steve Jobs died
1211,They were obviously ignoring Nvidia for so long that they were not even aware that AI will be built on their technology.
1212,Watching videos on Spotify. LOL.
1213,"nice, they are fighting failure (AI) with failure (new UI)!"
1214,"Who makes those comic panels for you? They look great, would love to follow their work!"
1215,"Siri, Apple Intelligence.  Tim Cook.  All bullshit.  All going down the tubes."
1216,Apple fanbous gonna buy everything anyway. Even literal shit with logo
1217,I love this channel. And the fact you use your own chill music is a big part of it. ðŸ˜Š
1218,I love apple because their products are perfection. Sadly Iâ€™m more and more disappointed both as a glazer and a shareholder :/
1219,The AI comic was weird.
1220,"Bought an iPhone 16 Pro at the start of this year, after years of using a Samsung Galaxy S9. I was shocked at how clunky it was compared to my old phone. In some instances, it didn't work at all. I switched back to the S25 Ultra; a great decision, especially after looking at their ""liquid glass"" BS."
1221,"Siri has NEVER worked well. I went through a phase where I just stopped using it and associated it with anger. Only reason I use it now is because of HUE lights. I was actually starting to forget how much I despised Siri, but the past year, they did something and broke it on Iwatch. Iâ€™m back to hating it."
1222,"rotten to the core. every competent product person has left. only the silicon design team ist still functional and top-notch. it's tim cook's fault, he's the ultimate fruit squeezer. short-term shareholder value to the max"
1223,"I think Apple with follow the blackberry legacy soon,, now days huawei and windows have grow up much faster with new hardware and software feature"
1224,Apple Intelligence is so secure that they don't add context while quering AI. So Secure! ðŸ” That explains the dumb responses from siri. ðŸ˜‚
1225,they should learn from Nokia
1226,I died when I realized apple intelligence is taking the onion as a serious news source ðŸ¤£
1227,"""rare"" yeah if you ignore server, workstation and desktop (not laptop). Whole classes of products lost, probably for good. They lost artists, musicians, video editors, the list goes on."
1228,They shot them selves in the foot. They didn't need to lie they could have just used chat  slowly added a.i features and just use a custom version on gpt in the meantime. They ruined their reputation dishonesty never a good idea
1229,What company has pulled ahead with generative AI?
1230,Can't wait for Apple to be forgotten like Blackberry. They're heading there for sure.
1231,"Unbelievably, could be an actual genuine threat to Apple. That's the level of disruption this tech is."
1232,"It's to easy to say Steve would have never let it get to this point. He had his failed products too. But he did understand what a good product was and what it should be or could do. The real problem is actually Tim Cook. Software is entering a time when large AI models full integration. Tim is a bean counter and not a visionary. The products like services, watch, airpods are all far more easy to bring to market then AI because it's so dynamic. This is possibly Apples Nokia moment of missing the boat. While they always are never first to the game, In this case with how fast paced AI is, they don't have a way to catch up now. The only way they can salvage this is probably to do a deal with Google for Gemini support and use Siri as the gatekeeper. This idea isn't so crazy as it offloads development and Google already pay Apple to have Google search as default on safari. But long story short, they are to late so a new approach is needed."
1233,I thought apple is super behind since Galaxy S3.. let alone Xiami 15 Ultra. Apple has been over for 5 years already it'll just take the mob a long time to realise.
1234,There is a striking parallel here with how Microsoft lost its dominance by being late in the arrival of the smartphone. I feel Apple will start to lose its marketing position fast. Worse over is that being in their walled garden has lost its luster. Its no longer a 'hip'  thing and the quality is dropping while innovation is falling behind. It remains to be seen who will take over as I am not certain whether it will be OpenAI for instance but we will see.
1235,Now they make the UI translucent so we can't see the mess anymore.
1236,Thanks
1237,"If Elon Musk can do it, why can't we?"
1238,"Apple should have said iPhone with Chat Gpt, not iPhone with Apple intelligence"
1239,Great video. It is so obvious that apple is losing their direction. We need another 1997 Steve Jobs moment to get them back on track
1240,"not releasing something yet â‰  Failure.
Da eff is wrong with you."
1241,"It seems that Apple is repeating the same mistakes as the former world's largest mobile device manufacturer....Cough, Nokia...What?"
1242,The background music of the video confuses me.
1243,Shmuck-Phone is ridiculously overpriced almost everywhere across the world.
1244,what the helly is blessing my ears
1245,Apple is in the Microsoft Windows Vista era
1246,"we have reached peak consumer hardware. the current grift is LLMs, i mean ""AI"""
1247,"It doesn't matter how much Apple lags behind technologically, because it's loyal users are cult-like followers that will keep buying their products.

When/if Apple does launch an AI contender, they will market it to Oblivion somehow making it seem as if they had created the AI concept itself. People will keep buying and that's the end of it."
1248,Apple may be behind in the AI game but still not behind in phone selling because phones are still not being sold based on AI capabilities.
1249,"A rare failure? MobileMe, Ping (iTunes social network), Project Titan, AirPower, iPod Hi-Fi, Butterfly Keyboard, AppStore (its current state and saga with Epic), iPhone 4 Antennagate..."
1250,Apple is done
1251,*What happened? Steve Jobs died. Innovation stopped.*
1252,"I don't know what's going on but... As a PC, Windows guy, Apple's laptops are fire ðŸ”¥ðŸ¤·ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸"
1253,I can't stand your fake voice
1254,Ground news I swear has had 30 different people who started it.
1255,13:04 A multi-trillion dollar company with BILLIONS in cash reduced the budget on CHIPSâ€¦.WOWâ€¦.FIRE THAT PERSON!
1256,"What is the point of compilin buch of videos, to propose a narrative? Not worth to watch a manipulative, repetitive, edited content."
1257,Here for the Apple fanbois commentsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1258,"Unpopular opinion here: I'm a long-time subscriber, but this video felt stretched regarding Apple's AI implementation. Anyone who actually works with AI knows LLMs have limited use cases, and are more about pattern matching than a true AGI in progress. This is more of a reaction from Apple fanbse."
1259,Even the Chinese startup Deepseek is far ahead of Apple in terms of AI
1260,I like how you did the comics to tell the story could you tell me what you use to create that
1261,"Apple's P/E ratio makes no sense, it should not be that much higher than Google's."
1262,We are about a decade away from on-device chips being powerful enough and power-conscious enough to work LLMs.
1263,Who cares of siri it chat gpt is an app on my iPhone? Just keep making shiny toys like liquid glass
1264,"I ran a small size LLM on my m2 iPad, why canâ€™t apple do it"
1265,"I think Apple has peaked, because liquid glass is not it."
1266,Apple will have a new CEO within a year.
1267,"another ""fake it til you make it"" story of silicon valley, Elon Musk, Theranos, Apple, FTX"
1268,apple can sell the exact same phone for the next 10 years and will still make a profit. why? cos they are a cult
1269,i regret buying iphone16. this is the first and last!
1270,"I would never invest in Apple at the current price/earnings level.  It's clear this is a not a well-run company anymore, if it ever was.  There is clearly a very bad culture there with some really bad people in high positions, and if a company is rotten it usually comes from the man at the top.    Apple has a higher P/E than Google!   Google which is constantly inventing and shipping revolutionary products! Google which has the best AI models.   But the P/E suggests that Apple has more growth potential than Google?!?!"
1271,now apple kills intel macs and contributing greatly to the e-waste.
1272,They are loosing in processor war also. Earlier iPhone processors had 2 years lead to android. But 8 elite chip is better in some cases now.
1273,"make audio levels balanced more between the voiceovers and interviews next time, please"
1274,Apple is dead
1275,Check this video before you celebrate too much? The Illusion of Thinking // The new Apple AI paper is...something
1276,"I think this is a problem across tech. Almost everything is substandard or unnecessarily complicated. Cars have become complicated ( I want physical dials back, and fixing something small shouldn't require specialised tools), AAA gaming is shit, Intrusive AI is shoved everywhere in my devices, Windows now uses fucking React for their apps and not to mention their uninstallable bloatware, fucking ads everywhere mahn, NVIDIA straight up bollocksed folks with their 50's series, as for phones most major brands are overpriced and at this point going Chinese is not such a bad idea in the phone market."
1277,You always had the feeling that 'Apple AI' was just a couple of guys in a shack in India.
1278,"*This man is paid by google (Apples competitor) to create youtube videos,  Also mos tlikly a heavy android user who dislikes Apple.*"
1279,"At the speed of how OpenAI and Google, Claude are developing - I honestly don't see how they'll catch up. They're really starting to become Microsoft during the smartphone era."
1280,"Think it all depends on what kind of lessons Apple really learns from this (if any), and how they end up actually applying it. Going by their track record, there's a greater than typical chance that the hit will ultimately be very moderate: Apple's greatest success is in many ways not actually selling devices, it's selling head canon. That puts them in a different league of ability to redirect, deflect and respin narratives."
1281,â€œAI for the rest of usâ€ is such a bad tagline as well
1282,"Really liked the comics stylization. Really helps understand what is being told. Good stuff. 

Wonder how it was done ? 

Thanks !"
1283,Everything Apple does is a fail for any reasonable person
1284,Everything Apple does is a fail for any reasonable person
1285,apple intelligence failure.....sums up apple perfectly
1286,Ill save you 20 minutes: they hired too many indians.
1287,"The old strategy could work if one is innovative, which Apple has been anything but for the past decade. But now, with how fast AI is changing, they need to be innovative and quick. They're now two steps off their usual strategy. And let's be real, Tim is not fit for that. He's the production guy, Steve was the innovator. Tim was the right guy to keep the machine well oiled and running when Steve left, but now the machine is no longer relevant with the current landscape. And Steve made Jony the face of innovation to give the people something to look forward to. Under Tim, there's no face doing that part, which is why they seem stale."
1288,"I think that the apple headquarter is the cybertruck of buildings. If I had to work in that building or stroll through that nightmare park in the middle, I would start fights with co-workers, too. 
Apple is slowly coming back to reality. It had to happen eventually. Jobs made several mistakes. People tend to forget that more and more. Anybody remember apple tv or the itunes phone. The Iphone before the iphone. When he was right, he hit it big. 
Point being, apple had a lot of luck and now they finally are going back to just being a company. Sometimes successful, sometimes not."
1289,"If a company's existence relies solely on one person, you don't have a great company. Steve Jobs isn't here to pick these guys up."
1290,"Apple fan since forever but let's not forget, get woke, get broke."
1291,"its just to drive the stock price down, so they can grow again"
1292,By putting all iphone model with 4gb of ram hahahah Enjoyed all liquid AsssðŸ˜‚
1293,"All of this sounds early similar to what happened at Nokia few years before it's death. It was about the entire operating system not just one feature (AI) so the impact for Apple will probably be smaller, but it shows how apple is no longer innovative company."
1294,Rare? Uhm have you forgotten about the Apple VR headset
1295,"Substitute phone with car and Apple with Tesla and notice the similarities, with two tiny differences - Apple haven't been promising AI for almost 10 years and phones don't (directly) kill people..."
1296,When there is a gold rush you making money by selling spades!
1297,"Yeah, apple intelligence has been a huge let down every time I've tried it, it can't even summarise a web page properly, talk about a let down"
1298,"3:40 Steve Jobs also faked the iPhone launch but here we are.. Like AI, they can learn from their apparent failure."
1299,Apple has lost its mojo since Steve Jobs died. Nothing exciting comes out of Apple since.
1300,"Nice video. But what you say about internal fighting, going around people's backs. having two teams competing for the same thing, etc. may sound worse the way you say it than reality. Apple is not a company where people are supposed to just do what they're told, it's a place where you're expected to do what you believe is great work. If other people don't share your ideas, you try to convince them, even if they are your seniors. It's constantly emphasised to connect and collaborate with people all around the company to help you achieve your vision. Apple is not built on lines of command, but on ""tumbling rocks"" and striving to get the best through a lot of convincing, prototyping, competition, etc. Having two departments compete to do the same thing in a different way is not an anomaly, and it's not seen as a bad thing necessarily. Two teams with different visions can just work very hard to realize their ideal and then we can see which idea was best in the end. That's better than the two teams working together on a poor compromise that doesn't achieve any of the ideals that either imagined. Apple might seem like a well structured company on the outside, but it has always been messy on the inside, and that's how it's meant to be, by Steve Jobs' design when he rejoined."
1301,Is Apple going to be the next Nokia?
1302,If it's iA apple would have nailed.
1303,Crapple
1304,The notification on Tucker Carlson actually sounds believable
1305,this is because AI was over hyped and still is over hyped by the Finance Industry. Ask any person who actually works on the technical side of AI and they will tell you that what the Finace Industry says is so removed from reality. Apple caused this problem because of their need to appease the Financial people in Apple (in my opinion).
1306,"Apple hasn't had success at anything since Steve Jobs died. The company is just coasting on momentum right now. They launched the disastrous Vision Pro goggles,  Apple Intelligence, etc."
1307,"funny cus apple could easily buy out an ai company like perplexity ai and implement their models in their software, but because of their incompetence and stubbornness, they wouldn't"
1308,"oh cmon! it's always been ""fake it until you make it"" and internal competition. don't you know apple culture? this time they simply haven't delivered."
1309,"I recently bought a secondhand iPhone 15 Pro Max, which was one of the very first iPhones capable of running Apple Intelligence, as my new phone, and I'm extremely happy with it: the screen and speakers are amazing and every action or process feels instant. While I don't need to install the following games on my iPhone, as they already run really well on my Mac Studio, it's also pretty cool to have a phone with a GPU powerful enough to run Death Stranding or Resident Evil Village. Even so, I don't give a damn about Apple Intelligence and won't be setting it up on my new iPhone or any of my Apple Silicon Macs, and MKBHD was right about how the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max felt very incomplete on launch, as they were advertised with AI features that flat-out weren't ready yet."
1310,"Correction: Steve Jobs pushed his workers to work hard, innovate and improve software and user experience. You can see how after him there has not been any progression in their offerings"
1311,Bruh ts pmo I hate when a video is badly edited/made for 2x speed
1312,Bruh ts pmo I hate when a video is badly edited/made for 2x speed
1313,"Plan, the â€œmapsâ€ of Apple is still crap. My mother use it because itâ€™s implemented in the phone (and more easy for her), and have at multiple times been very badly directed by it, even found herself in the wrong placesâ€¦ I donâ€™t understand how itâ€™s still possible in 2025."
1314,Apple fell off after Steve Jobs died
1315,"Why are they facing class action law suit just now? 
They have been doing this for ages. On every single iPhone release and WWDC. Promising something that they cant deliver. To name a few:

Deep fusion on their cameras
Airpower"
1316,Apple pulling an Nvidia over there.
1317,All these pleb Apple hate takes in the comments just shows how poor people really are.
1318,"Apple, with its accountant TIM as a leader, is COOKked."
1319,"Guys what has Apple done so far? They took Sony's camera, Samsung's screen and hit us. We haven't seen ANY innovation. They are nothing but the world's biggest marketing company."
1320,Maybe I'm weird but I like my Macbook WITHOUT AI. I'd go to ChatGPT if I need AI stuff anyway like how I'd use Google etc. The Silicon M chip is super powerful so maybe Apple need to go on and keep up the good work.
1321,Thanks for the super gay soundtrack. Exactly what I was looking for while learning about Apple Intelligenceâ€™ failure. ðŸ˜‚
1322,"Apple should make hardware and leave software to Android and Windows or Linux. (Windows 11 isn't great but, it works)"
1323,"who gives a rats ass, im sick of all these evil tech companies and their invasive surveillance technology, all designed to make a small group wealthy and powerful and the rest of us more stranded up shit creek without a paddle"
1324,No offence but who cares about eraser function
1325,Great episode as always. Keep it up
1326,Tim Half Cooked! ðŸ˜‚
1327,"Thanks for the summary of the whole story. Personally, Iâ€™m done with Apple. I bought my last phone, a 16pro, specifically for a better Siri. My 14pro was otherwise fine. I have never used Siri less on this new phone. Next generation Iâ€™m going back to Android."
1328,"I have mixed feeling about this. I recall seeing those new Apple AI apps' icons on iPhone last year looked so un-Apple, I knew it was rushed. But didn't know they weren't thereðŸ¤¦â€â™‚On the other hand, I would be ok if Apple went slow in AI because of business choice. But the current situation is due to mismanagement."
1329,"Apple AI might suck, but I did get double RAM in my new mac book without getting bent over!"
1330,"apple silicon is not a product, is just a processor. Extremely powerful for sure, but useless without the right product or software..."
1331,apple doesnt usually miss???? I dont think they have hit even once in the past 5 years.
1332,The failure that few noticed because so few people use Siri and that because Siri has always been a failure.
1333,World's most valuable tech company?? Bro Apple has not been that in a while now.
1334,Didnâ€™t MKBHD also sell his overpriced wallpaper app on a promise of all features coming up later?
1335,"""You're watching Cold Fusion TV"",  makes my day every single time. Thank you lol"
1336,someone should just sue Apple based on the fake demo alone!!
1337,Seems Warren buffet knew what he was doing when selling his stocks
1338,Indian engineers hiring other indian engineers... fake it till you make it mantra
1339,I'm worried about my 20 apple stocks that I bought.
1340,"How come MY Gemini can't ""SEE"" through the camera and he tells me he can't use the camera to SEE?"
1341,"a ""rare"" failure ? always been trash"
1342,"the apple paper was an absolute train wreck. it spoke of the obvious but as if apple somehow made a new discovery, but it was only a move to discourage the development of AI and justify their lack of incentives for improving their own software products. they had checked out after seeing the failures they made and by how much the opponents had left them behind. it was a good strategic move, but the execution wasn't very much confusing, especially when people can visibly and in real-time observe the progress of technology and the new breakthroughs that people make with AI technologies, in a matter of weeks, and regularly.

we're living in a crazy time. if that becomes overwhelming as it naturally will, it's okay to say ""i want out."" the mistake is when you starts trying to make excuses for it. that's when you start becoming dishonest, and people will out you for it. if you want out, let the truth out.

all i want to know isn't the corporate organizations are competent, because i know they are. all i care about is if the corporate organization isn't entirely dishonest when they're the ones trying to sell me a product."
1343,"I don't know where this idea that apple is famous for great software (and have now failed unexpectedly ) comes from. I think this is marketing created perception overwriting history. If one re-thinks this  (IMO wrong) assumption it all suddenly makes sense. Apple has historically had great hardware, no argument there. (although u can argue It's the same value per buck than other manufacturers) But you have apple Silicon ðŸ‘ impressive. The build quality and technical achievements of the Johny Ives era of devices ðŸ‘Œgreat. But at the same time, on the software side this was going on: Incompatible Software, plagued with unending spinners of loading death on the early 2000s, the first Iphones had cameras but couldn't do video ðŸ˜† when all competitors could. Siri! was crap from the start, inmediately surpassed by google assistant. Apple Maps fiasco. Forced OS upgrades fiascos, Inflexible UIs, the iphone literally just got a customizable home screen a couple years back. Don't even talk about safari. I think is fair to say: Once again apple has failed at software in spite of having better hardware and a closed ecosystem. Is just how it is. If you really think about it, most famous apple software is third-party software (like final cut) showing that even the independent devs can do more with the advantages of a closed ecosystem than apple themselves can. The only piece of software that I think of as famously good apple software is AirDrop, but while is technically software it heavily relies on the hardware of the ecosystem. Which is probably the only reason they are still holding that ground. I have used Apple products in spite of their software historically , not because of it."
1344,"..and this is why VP Marketing and VP Tech have been forced out to do interviews together.. ""now you can't blame each other""."

They will be a quadrillion dollar company now our beloved apple has face planted AI already took off like what they say the ship has already sailed. This guy is trying to catch up using paddle on a small canoe sad but true. in our lifetime, there will only be one Steve Jobs and unless miraculously be reincarnated. we miss you, Mr. Jobs. we miss the one more thing."
1348,Like that you upped the rendering quality on the Cold Fusion comics we all know and loveâ€¦
1349,"They spent 10 bn over like 10 years to build a self driving car until they finally admitted that it can't be done (while Tesla is still fishing investor gold with this method) and scrapped it to focus more resources on AI. The failure of Siri to improve is probably created by the opportunity costs of this car. On that note, I am using the Google in my house and it's arguably every bit as bad as Siri. It almost feels like it was better in 2018 when I first installed the system. It's really time to just make even the smallest of Gemini models the engine that creates the interaction. The crappiness of these voice assistants is just unacceptable in times when we have near-magic AI already accessible free for all. I never tried Alexa so I can't judge that one."
1350,"WTF is it with this loud, awful music over everything?"
1351,"Cook is no founder. He is an employee of Apple. So, he will never think of his products as HIS (like Steve), but just a job!"
1352,Anyone buying something on a promise (especially ai) is an idiot.
1353,"My impression is that Apple lives off the outdated mobile texting infrastructure in the USA, which makes iMessage look modern in comparison."
1354,we have to care ???? cult made a mistake ?
1355,"Apple was always a crap company with crap products made for idiots, you know it ðŸ˜Š
Samsung only â¤"
1356,"So, Apple reacted to ChatGPT the same way that Nokia and Microsoft reacted to the iPhone"
1357,Maybe they should create an AI version of Steve Jobs and bring him back to the board once more
1358,"Iâ€™m so happy for this, donâ€™t really want the superfluous features"
1359,Nice filler content.
1360,"Gemini is the best A.I. Assistant out there, nothing can beat it ðŸ˜Š."
1361,"Apple Intelligence managed to make my Siri worse. (Slow on just setting on a timer/alarm, the only function I use it on)

Thatâ€™s amazing in its own right."
1362,Agreed: apple softwares are so buggy no better then android
1363,Apple died with Steve Jobs. It's now a soulless husk. A capitalist machine. Apple has fallen far from the tree. ðŸŽ»
1364,Apple should hire an Indian CEO next â€” might take innovation to a whole new level. ðŸ˜‚
1365,Apple is so cooked
1366,PALANTIR  makes  software  (that  works.)
1367,damn bruh ai comics now coldfusion???? im not a fan of it bro
1368,Well this is what you get when you focus more on satisfying the shareholders instead of developing amazing tech that renders profit into a natural side effect. So they got a bit of time left before they go NOKIA.....
1369,"I have a 15PM, Siri is mostly useless for normal things and I have no idea what Apple intelligence is have to do except skip songs while Iâ€™m driving. Unless Apple start implementing basic phone features that Android has had for years, this could be my last for quite a while."
1370,"Ive been feeling that the quality of apple products is declining ever since Steve Jobs was gone. While the competition is only getting better. The thing that got me hooked on iPhone, was that maybe it did not have all the features everyone else had, but the ones it had were just perfect. I remember when I had the iphone 3gs, and everyone around me had something else, I would keep getting shocked reactions on how well it worked compared to their phones."
1371,"Are rare failure like TV, car, speaker, wireless charging and VR?"
1372,Apple sucks. Only their chips are good. Everything else is overpriced bs.
1373,CEO needs to step down along with several heads.
1374,This is because every tech company follows the fake it till you make it method. They're faking so hard that they can't make it anymore

1382,"This is from DeepSeek - ðŸ’¡ **In essence**: Apple isn't ""incompetent""â€”it's optimizing for **trust and ecosystem cohesion** over AI dominance. As one analyst notes, *""Cupertino is playing it safe... but has a tight window to figure this out""* . Competence here is measured by seamless utility, not leaderboard rankings."

1385,"That was the 1st version > we are 16 generation later > all companies go soft and be comfortable > the top talent leaves to other more real quality focused companies, who are not just about marketing scams..."
1386,"Apple survives just on  branding nowadays, not really much innovation after Steve Jobs. All they do now is copy what everyone else is doing and somehow it becomes innovative and everyone goobles it up. The problem with that approach is if you cant copy it fast enough you get left behind. Something like AI for example you cant copy it overnight."
1387,AI race is not something you can master in a year or so you need constant improvement and good power apple failed here and they are late the price is high for this in future..
1388,"Apple doesn't innovate anymore, it just takes the safer route"
1389,AI won't let apple catch up anymore.
1390,"Can you imagine.  Theyâ€™ll have to keep bumping up their chips to keep up with the AI competition.  Inevitably, having devices so powerful other companies will struggle to compete outside of AI as developers start building powerful games and software for Apple and no one will be able to competeâ€¦ ðŸ¤”"
1391,"Apple lost their way long ago, this is just more of their decade long and counting downward slide"
1392,Just a bump in the roadâ€¦. Their big issue is security and being a leader in on device AIâ€¦  It needs to show that on-device AI is better than the competition.  A tough road but a doable one.
1393,"The last vestige of Steve Jobs DNA has now gone from Apple. Quality is no longer their selling point :(

It is sad that the 2nd or 3rd largest company in the world has forgotten how to get the basics right. Iâ€™ve been a loyal iPhone and Mac user since 2010 ðŸ˜¢"
1394,"Why ColdFusion still doesnâ€™t make 4K videos - is what this video needed to be about. Itâ€™s 2025 Dagogo, thatâ€™s probably mixing music in mp3 too!??

1397,"Oh ghod!!! iPhone touchscreens! Yuck! Hopeless! I hate Android user experience, and iOS is a great system for how I use my phone, but the touchscreen is unresponsive trash. I've been an Apple fanboi since 1984 and I hate the iPhone touchscreens! Hate isn't a strong enough word."
1398,With all the internal politics and backstabbing it almost feels like there's no point to get so personally invested in your work if you are an entry level employee... You could create the best product in the world but have it shelved just because of a bunch rowdy executives :(
1399,Jobs is rolling in his grave over the flop remake of vista glass lol
1400,"So, selling a phone that is unable to make a phone call by itself seems to be a crime now. Selling a car that drives you straight into a wall, no that is perfectly legal. Well, the difference is in how much you br.. spend in buying a country."

1434,"No love for this company at all, but it is shocking to see them fall so completely on their face.  They aren't the most valuable company in the world without reason."
1435,"Appleâ€™s main challenge today is the absence of Steve Jobsâ€™ visionary leadership, which drove its most groundbreaking innovations. The company has largely relied on products invented over a decade ago, like the iPhone, with recent models seen as incremental rather than revolutionary compared to competitors. Despite heavy investment in R&D and advances in custom silicon, AI, and AR/VR, Appleâ€™s new innovations have yet to match the impact of the Jobs era. Nonetheless, the strong brand legacy built by Jobs continues to sustain Appleâ€™s market dominance and customer loyalty, though there is increasing pressure for the company to regain its reputation as a true innovation leader. Having used iPhones from the 3 all the way up to the 13, Iâ€™m seriously considering making the switch to Google for my next phone, cause SIRI is seriously.... ancient."

1444,Apple warned us in 2023 - they said that forcing Apple to use USB-C instead of their proprietry lightning charger would 'stifle innovation'. So we can't really blame Apple for the lack of innovation in recent years. It's not their fault this was forced upon them.

That kind of approach offers real potential for personal, secure, and deeply integrated user experiences. AI should feel like a personal partner, much like how we interact with our iPhones today. I personally find all the hype around loud, flashy AI and robotic solutions a bit disconnected, they often miss the point of enhancing genuine human connection and experience.

1456,"New visitors at work have to scan a QR code to complete a short induction. The android phones struggle to recognise the QR code while the iPhones do it immediately. The iPhone is superior to any android, to think otherwise is fooling yourself. My previous phone was a Samsung and used to randomly run out of battery below 30%. My new iPhone? Something like 3 hours of use below 30%. Do yourself a HUGE favour and get an iPhone, you will have so many less problems."

1465,"I remember Henny Penny losing her shit back in 1996, and here we are $3T later. We shall see. I wish I had money to put on Apple, because I have seen this story before. I recdntly read an article sourced from Apple which defined what they expected from an AI a' la Chatbot, et al, and when you read what we should expect from an interactive AI, nobody is even close yet. There is still time to emerge at the top of the heap. Thinking back to 1996 - you never know. Apple could secretly be making a holgraphic Steve Jobs with an AGI brain, and devoting all their AI effort into perfecting THAT!"
1466,I feel so sorry for Apple. It was the epitomes of innovation and ground breaking ideas. There is a new king that in some parts of this world do not even mention. Huawei
1467,"This kind of demand should also be made of developers who promise games and when they come out on the market, they are a disaster full of errors."
1468,I still think Apple did a good job with the upgrade.
1469,"But the thing is: Is AI really so important in terms of using a phone or other devices in our daily life? Personally I don't even use Gemini or ChatGPT much every day but only on certain occasions when I need help from AI. I think AI is just overly hyped. In fact, Apple can always introduce AI subscription based models for paying customers and tap into OpenAI via iOS or Mac OS. There is no need for Apple to actually bake AI into their platforms. Why reinvent the wheels?!"

1479,"TBF with Apple , all of those problem with AI other company face it before but that's why they had more experienced to deal with and keep making it better. 
This is why AI hit Apple so hard and model of ""slow but better"" keep falling apart. Apple still use same tactic that ditching all other AI and using base model of OpenAI and start to do develop by themselves. but without a lot of mistake case Apple won't be able to make it good especially compete with other company that update every week learn of each other mistake. 
Not including consumer face problem with AI at first time everyone just laugh off and keep using. but for Apple this is not ""first time"" ppl had to face slop AI and it make Apple user felt dated.(Which is true)

Apple need to learn that AI can't use same tactic or they will out of this AI market."

1525,"7:55 Ok the object eraser thing I donâ€™t believe is completely fair. I donâ€™t think Apple intends for people to have the option to totally and drastically alter an image by circling an area etc. Thatâ€™s just not the way Apple does things. One of their foundational values is standing behind authentic creativity, the thing that generative AI is massively violating. Iâ€™ve been using generative AI since long before 99% of people even knew what that was, much less had been give the opportunity to use yet. It largely is just a gimmick, and Apple doesnâ€™t really wanna implement gimmicks (particularly if they violate authenticity). Thatâ€™s my take. I think in a year or two the whole generative ai thing will become kinda silly to literally almost every single person and those that will still use it will take it *really* seriously."
1526,"I personally believe that innovation at Apple died the day Steve died, and (always IMHO) the ONLY true innovation in Cook's time (i.e. Apple Silicon) is actually a rip-off from Huawei's Kirin SoC. I do not find this hard to believe at all"

1529,Warren Buffet's spies at Apple saw the impending disaster. He dumped over half his stock in Apple a year ago.
1530,"At first I thought this was just the natural fallout of jumping on the AI hype train, but it actually sounds like Apple is failing as a company and full of incompetent executives.  Surprising as an Android user (which let me tell you is not something I'm proud of or happy with).  However, they fully deserve to be knocked down a peg, they've been a bad player in the scene for a long time with anti-competitive practices, a refusal to do what is best for consumers and not playing well with standards.  The crazier thing is that they can keep screwing up and their rabid fan base will spend $1000's on their phone anyway.  We'll see if the future proves them wrong, that they can't just keep shoveling BS to consumers and succeed."

Everyone who is expecting Apple to be good at AI is like expecting them to be good at search 20 years ago. 

I dunno why Apple thinks they need their own AI. Siri should just be the text/voice based interface, and you can plug in whichever AI you like. 

OpenAI should pay Apple a huge sum per year to default into ChatGPT (just like Google search right now), but people can switch to whichever AI model they like that supports iOS. 

I do understand that Apple totally brought this onto themselves, but yeah, they didnâ€™t do search and theyâ€™re perfectly fine."

1542,I liked the use graphic-novel esque images when constructing the story. But now I'm curious where you got these from? Or is it AI-generated...
1543,Apple needs to build a JOBS 9000 to take control of the whole place.
1544,Apple has a bean counter problem. They have to fire somebody.
1545,Bill Gates turned Microsoft around on a dime when he blew the WWW decision. Apple Maps is now better than Google Maps. Apple's bank is big enough to fix this and their fan boys are not going anywhere. Now is a good time to buy Apple stock.

Otherwise very informative"
1547,I'm in no rush to buy a new phone but when that time comes it won't be a replacement apple. 100%
1548,"Time, it appears, is circular in the Tech sphere. Apple hired John Sculley to be its CEO, the former head of Pepsi ""Sugar-Water"" , he came from a dramatically different CULTURE and drove the company off a cliff. Apple righted the ship and re-hired Jobs, learning a valuable lesson in following its OWN culture. Seems the same thing happened again in hiring this Amazon exec, only to be secretly undercut by Jobs loyalists. Culture lesson learned, direction re-established, Apple can once again forge into the future, on its own terms."

1554,I think Apple is in trouble.
1555,Apple has $100s of billions in cash reserve and can make anything it wants happen if they wanted to. This is very much an intentional move due to philosophical differences especially with privacy in mind. Theyâ€™ll enter the market with AI once AI becomes more refined and reliable
1556,"Steve Jobs should be rolling in his grave, Tim Cook is just blowing it !"
1557,Love to see it

Over the years, Apple phones have only been introducing minor upgrades with price bumps, and Tim was able to convince the fan boys they were incremental upgrades with premium price, while android users had these features a long while ago."
1560,That's what you get when you align with those globalist technocratic totalitarianism agenda 2030 & Net Zero scam.

1562,"Apple is just copying Elon's play book, announce full self driving ""coming next year"" for nearly a decade to pump you stock price. And why wouldn't they, their are no consequences for the big boys...
Siri has been so useless for so long Apple should just give it to ALL of us free instead of trying to make us buy another new expensive phone that offers nothing new. 
They don't even sell a phone with one handed operation anymore, sure many want massive phones nowadays but there are still plenty who want something pocketable and capable."

The features in Apple are soo restrictive and outdated when compared to Samsung or Google. I feel current Apple phones are dumped down version of a Samsung or Google phone. Like a Phone for Dummies. I'm not trying to insulat the users. But honestly, the features are outdated. 
One example, IPhone users were soo happy 4 years ago about the launch of the widget. I had a widget on my Samsung Galaxy S3 that was launched in 2012."

Nothing new ever comes out of Apple, only repackaging of an existing idea. And in some cases, it has taken several years for Apple to even catch up to competitors. 
With Trump running the USA to the ground, I don't see how people can afford  to buy into Apple (always) premium products. I don't see the world demanding more of them. In fact, demand seems to be dwindling except for a few diehards."

1591,"I find it weird that for your intro, you picked a guy that only makes YouTube videos that bash on Apple products. While he doesnâ€™t even show what version of iOS heâ€™s on (I suspect a BETA version) he literally says heâ€™s â€œspent the last week or so looking for a ton of examples of Apple software not behaving correctlyâ€. This is leading and bias in your own reporting."
1592,"Great news, and eagerly await the demise of all the other tech giants pushing AI tech. I really do not want my life controlled and ruined by my phone dictating my choices in life; I can do that all by myself thank you! I'm old enough to have known simpler and happier times, yet I meet young people every day that present with a phobia that I never knew existed the day before...they have also, like the rest of the flock, been seduced by the sheer 'techiness' of modern western society. Coincidence? I think not. 
Congrats on the 5 mil subs Dagogo. Happy days."

Promise after promise from Elon turns out to be a lie, such as the self-driving features. The response of Apple fans tells us something important about Apple's customers: Apple is just a product to them, not a religion. They may generally love the product and be loyal to the brand, but this is still just a product. If this were Tesla, this would just be another Tuesday and the fanbase would double down on its religious fervor for Elon."

1611,"You could tell by the fact that Apple didn't even want to use the phrase ""AI"" or ""Artificial Intelligence"" because they considered it beneath them to use buzzwords that every other tech company was using.  So, Apple Intelligence came out...kind of.  The thing is, they missed the ball probably because they don't really care about their userbase beyond coming out with another phone just like the previous one, but whose number is one higher, and cost is a little higher."
1612,Steve Jobs would've initiated a Stalin level purge of the company if he took one look at modern iOS
1613,"Apple missed foldables, messed VR glasses, they shamefully leech from payments made by and to others in their phones, and now they missed AI. Looks like a sinking ship!"
1614,so waht Steve Jobs said just proves apple is lazy let everyone one else tinker and innovate we will just steal your ideas like with the iPod there where mp3 players before the iPod that can store a thousand songs
1615,"To be fair, Apple might be right on this topic. Time only will tell but a lot of smart people already said that AI possibly was used in Silicon Valley to gin up investments and drive the stocks but so far AI is basically a fancier Google Search with voice and visual recognition nothing really new. And I tend to agree."
1616,do you think this is also the reason why warren buffet sold most of his shares in apple?
1617,"You are wrong about it not working. Please cite your sources instead of pulling out of your arse and otherwise say it as is, that all this â€œinfoâ€ is just simply rumors"
1618,All this started after Steve Jobs passed the reins over to Tim Cook who is not a visionary and does not have the passion for innovation and technology.  He is only interested in marketing and sales numbers.  It's just a matter of time before Apple becomes a byword in the history books ...
1619,this video could've been 5 minutes long
1620,Siri was always a joke. Itâ€™s so bad now I canâ€™t get any answers out of her for basic questions.
1621,The appropriate background footage here would be Gavin Belson from the Silicon Valley TV show just completely trashing his Mansion with his bare hands.
1622,"Not to defend Apple but it must be very difficult to keep that company running as its been for decades and always remaining a leader. They were able to go beyond the typical model of the 90s PC maker by innovating in other segments like phones, something that Microsoft, Dell, Compaq, or even Japanese Giants didn't achieve.
So, to satisfy investors and show that they can keep bringing the money, they have to make attempts in new segments, which unfortunately rarely greatly succeeded or just completely. The Apple Car and the Vision Pro are 2 good recent example. These projects haven taken away valuable resources that could have been allocated to other things, such as GenAI. But still, who knew that ChatGPT was going to be a huge deal. Most probably not Apple, because fundamentally, it's a computer/device maker and they are incredibly good at it. In fact, meanwhile this flop is happening, Apple pulled out the Apple Silicon, which keeps beating the market.
So personally, I'm not really worried about Apple missing the AI boat because on the long term, it's not a big deal and they will eventually get on track.
Hopefully, they will shift their focus from useless designs that bring no life improvements to the users (rounded corners, notches, dynamic islands, glass looking UIs, etc.) and focus on what's really bringing value."
1623,"This video highlights that Apple is getting sued for false advertising, yet Tesla and that hot mess get away with promising things that literally never come out? Or promoting things that can literally KILL people?

Double standards."
1624,"regarding liquid glass bugs, people are really overanalysing a first developer beta of a major UI overhaul.
the apple intelligence topic is absolutely fair though!"
1625,"Apple over the years under Tim Cook was busy bragging about DEI policy, instead of hiring talented people to advance Siri."

1631,"Years ago Steve Jobs gave an interview where he said the problem with companies like Pepsico and Zerox is that companies with monopolies end up driving the product people out and the sales and marketing people take over. 

Tim Cook is not a product person. He's sales and also ops (he streamlined the production of the iPhone to a ridiculous level of efficiency). He has no idea how to craft a good product. So he just delegates it to people who realize their job isn't to deliver good products, its to please Tim Cook.

Tim Cook is not a product person. He's sales and also ops (he streamlined the production of the iPhone to a ridiculous level of efficiency). He has no idea how to craft a good product. So he just delegates it to people who realize their job isn't to deliver good products, its to please Tim Cook.

1636,"iOS 9 was the last solid version. Since then all we got was emogeesâ€¦ crap. they outsourced the software development, it became a total mess .. apple should be sued for a sum so large it would Bankrupt them, that would trigger a total restructuring â€¦ maybe than weâ€™ll see results."
1637,"Lets be honest. What was ever the idea of apple or any Innovation they brought to the World? 
Jobs always wanted Apple to be like Sony, but guess what, Sony brought us so many innovative products and Technologies. Whilest Apple just tried to upsell us their weak Hardware with a very well functioning and good looking Software. 

This year i will switch to Android. To a chinese phone. It's just enough of their stupid promises. And i guess their Woke ideology Agenda. Jobs would fire anyone who doesn't deliver the workforce he needed. 
AT apple now, everything is cosy as the Cash flows (even this is a Lie, they dont even sell that many phones as they say.)"
1638,What is Tim Cook doing? He failed us with AI
1639,R.I.P.
1640,"He said ""My name is De-go-go?"" 18:40?"
1641,"Apple is lagging in the AI race because it doesnâ€™t have enough data. Prioritizing customer privacy comes at a cost, this could be one of many other reasons!"
1642,DEI kills
1643,i'll move to samsung this year.
1644,6:38
1645,Didn't Trevor Noah & Nikola get crushed for this?
1646,"I can say i have never brought an Apple product, for precisely these reasons. The price just doesn't compare to features. That being said I am also moving from Samsung because they have lost their mind with their prices as well. Almost Aud $3000 for their ultra phones ðŸ¤£. Going to give One plus 14 a try when it's out."
1647,AI = Apple Infighting
1648,Getting Apple chips in the most amount of peopleâ€™s hands is gonna allow AI/ML to run on-device. All for it
1649,Apple became Theranos. Something something poetry.
1650,So Apple pulled a Tesla? Sold products on empty future promises. ðŸ˜‚
1651,I truly donâ€™t know how any of this is a bad thing. I think itâ€™s good that Apple isnâ€™t shoving useless AI garbage I donâ€™t want into the phone
1652,"apple is so busy intentionally screwing up their physical design by putting the usb port at the bottom of the mouse, and the button at the bottom of mac mini, removing chargers, etc etc, than actually spending money for RND to get their AI working

Apple Intelligence reflects ""Apple's Intelligence"". They'll be the next Blackberry if they keep doing this bs."
1653,"Imagine if Steve was still alive, running Apple..."
1654,"Apple already died on my second device when they started to prevent jailbreaks.
An Apple device does not belong to the customer and can theoretically be rendered unusable by Apple at any time.
And the fact that batteries cannot be changed and no SD card slot is offered is a total killer criterion.
And there is only one reason for this, they simply want to charge 10 times the market value for the built-in memory and then sell a cloud subscription if possible.
And they make concessions to Trump and have no backbone!
Apple can go away! It's no shame for this overpriced electronic waste!"
1655,"Gemini is a turd, I want to turn it off."
1656,AI sucks people just don't realize it yet
1657,@ColdFusion loved the comic book style story telling method for this video.
1658,We Do Need ColdFusion AI.
1659,Apple died with Jobs.
1660,Shout out to all the people still singing appleâ€™s praises. This is my first and last iphone.
1661,"I also think Apple is struggling to make a decentAI solution, whilst keeping their privacy promises."
1662,since they got caught keeping your photos after you have deleted them. I stopped buying their products
1663,"this company is dying on the vine, they blew a billion dollars trying to develop a electric car and never did anything with it..they used to be run by dreamers and visionarys..now theyâ€™re run by bean counters that have zero vision"
1664,"Another video from this tool, another Apple Propaganda.."
1665,The comic book drawings are amazing. Great work!
1666,At least the vision pro was a smash hit
1667,Los chinos terminarÃ¡n acabando con ellos y Samsung.
1668,The issues are rooted back to the time Apple split from nvidia because of a set of failed GPU's
1669,Apple busy promoting rainbow
1670,"Tim Cook willing to throw people under the bus and not accept any responsibility, sounds like every other politician.... smh"
1671,"Fire Tim Cook, yesterday"
1672,iPhone is for people that don't know jack about usability.
1673,Tim Cook is getting old and real Pervy. DEI is showing it's fruits. I hate Siri. I use it most for HomeKit. It use to work well when HomeKit started out but now Siri gets everything wrong. Or it challenges me with a question when I want to change the temperature. Who needs interrogation sessions to turn on a light.
1674,Sounds like apple before jobs was kicked out Apple II vs Macintosh teams
1675,Steve Jobs must be rolling in his grave.
1676,"This is a misunderstanding of Apple's good points.  Apple has only delivered the old-school mac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.  Most other things apple has touched has been a pretty rough, failed, or just isn't profitable.  Apple AI is part of a long tradition of over sold but failed products... Perhaps one of the first that they have been caught as outright false advertizing... but their headset, a lot of their CPU/GPU transitions on different devices, their cloud services, servers and business lineup, the way they handle device management and mixed work/personal workloads, siri, maps... Apple is rough."
1677,They keep failing on this.
1678,"Wow, your production value is getting higher by the video ! Keep up the good work !"
1679,Which company can i give my money to that'll ensure theres NEVER AI on my device?
1680,"To be fair, many of the expensive chat bots donâ€™t exactly show any profit and itâ€™s not known when they willâ€¦

The smaller stuff is the more useful stuff, and in that department, excluding Siri, Apple did great.

Clean up is for background objects - 99% of the â€œhereâ€™s Appleâ€™s bad AI failing to remove this from the photoâ€ are testing removing from the foreground - which is not the purpose of the tech, and both Apple and Android companies say that. If you actually want to recreate an image in a different way - use chatGPT or something.

Personally their AI for something that is on device is pretty good. Itâ€™s not the best, but itâ€™s good. According to independent tests at least."
1681,The clown running Apple is so far from Jobs vision that it is totally past the horizon .................................
1682,Apple = Tesla = Vaporware
1683,Yea apple software is ass
1684,The irony is I get an ad for apple intelligence during the video
1685,"Customer: ""When will Apple Intelligence be fully effective?""
Siri v1: ""No.""
Siri v2: ""Funny, I was just about to ask you the same thing."""
1686,"Apple never did software 
Apple is a COMPUTER hardware company"
1687,Siri should disappear. Itâ€™s a name that signifies the worst of Apple.
1688,the ai comic portion was really unnecessary
1689,"probably worth watching state of the union, and the actual developer videos, not the keynote. apple is performing very strongly in AI for developers. it would seem the real fail at Apple is how to communicate what they are doing."
1690,Ive been using app for morethan 11 years now.. and am being forced to switch to android !!
1691,Itâ€™s no wonder CNET called out all of these hypocritical Siri drama queens suffering from a bad case of rushed AI selective memory. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚
1692,I think this guy does not understand how AI works and how AI gets knowledge.
1693,"When you become overgreedy and sell the same thing again and again with no innovation fooling people, you tend to become relaxed and thats what has happened with this company apple."
1694,"From a company whose own iPhone was based off a model of ""taking inspiration"" from other patented products, it's not surprising they've ended up here. Steve Jobs was the beginning of this greed, abusing the courts and patent infringement to get his way."
1695,Apple Intelligence is such an oxymoron. Sirii is still crap after more than 10 years of annual upgrades. Apple should just buy (gasp!!) Musk's Grok.
1696,Seems like apple has been going downhill since steeve jobs. The company lives off tge apple logo .They have become the definition of style over substance
1697,"Apple Impotence
Apple Ignorance
Apple Insecure
Apple Irresponsible
Apple Incompetent
Apple I have no ideas..."

1699,"It feels like if I see an iPhone user, I'm seeing a caveman using stone tools."
1700,"2:13 Well, at least a summary about Tucker Carlson seems totally correct. Also, it comes from one of the most reputable source."
1701,Please release Eunoia on Apple Music ðŸ™ðŸ™
1702,So the USA found out what it's like to be RoW after a product launch: promised features turn out to be nonsense as they are are 'USA only' and we don't get them (or they are really late).   I am not interested in AI and feel sorry for the people who rushed to buy the 16.
1703,"6:40 this is some next level cyberpunk Spyware shit. This is not exciting, it's terrifying."
1704,"1:05 - is that a joke ? Thats the standard to most industries these days under one form or another. The lawsuits aren't because those people care much, but because they know Apple has money and they can pay if anyone wins by any chance. Just vultures. Wish people would be more involved into right to repair and stuff that actually matters and benefits them more in the long run."
1705,"Ngl, it seems apple as a company is facing performance-mindset adhd burnout and struggling to adapt because of it. Lol."
1706,When has apple software ever been good?  It's good at making customers pay by refusing to update for arbitrary reasons and forcing apple ecosystem victims to spend an absurd amount of money for a new computer that performs as well as a regular computer you can get for half the price.
1707,"Let's be real - Android has always been the trendsetter. While Apple's busy polishing their 'perfect' image, Android's already out there pushing boundaries and setting the standard. Late to the party isn't innovation"
1708,Havenâ€™t seen Federighi trying to act like a super hero recently!
1709,"It's actually simple, it's the same that happened to Games Industry.

DEI hiring!!!

Hire the 10 place of the hiring interview and you have a product that hit the 10 place in public preference.

Stop to hire the best one for the job and start to hire based on Power Ranger cast and you will have some good people and some bad people instead of a team composed of the best.

What happens when you put a person that is not the best in the position that should be for the best? They magically start to deliver like the best? NO they deliver what they can, the 90-80-70% or less.

People complains about how triple A games aren't good anymore, how new products releases are not impactful as before.

You know who aren't complaining? Chinese with some of the best products from the last 5 years in a roll, best EV cars, best smartphones, best laptops, guess why? They hire the best!

Hiring the best one for the job was a common knowledge from the start of humanity, but know sounds offensive to say it out of loud."
1710,Tim Cook and the other execs are too used to just counting the  billions rolling in.
1711,Steve Jobs would have never let AI slipped like that.
1712,"Apple literally jumped out of flying plane, hoping they would find a parachute on their way down."
1713,"Jobs was an engineer, visionary and an artist......The leadership after his passing are just engineers. Their cure for everything is to update and upgrade what is, without thinking outside the box (reimagining what is existing and envisioning what could be). In order to advance in technology, just having an engineer mentality only will get you to where Apple is today. Jobs envisioned Siri to do much more than what his engineer minded hacks had done with it since his death, and now it has caught up with the company.  Chat got snuck up on Apple because a lot of engineering visionaries and artists put a lot of input from different backgrounds....Apple, on the other hand, inbred group think, and never saw what came with chat got because they were so successful doing the unimaginative stuff...for awhile.....But now it has caught up with them.

We will see this fall if the beginning of the end of their dominance is upon us..."
1714,Apple fell down
1715,Apple will achieve this! I believe in their philosophy!
1716,Siri never liked Apples
1717,IOS 26 ugly design
1718,I was going to jumped into the AI when Apple released it but I didnâ€™t and kept my iPhone 11 Pro Max
1719,Apple's are becoming staleðŸ˜‚
1720,Great video.
1721,I've never in my life heard anyone incapable of pronouncing *advertisements* ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
1722,"Nah, Apple's failures are manifold, they just still usually manage to be profitable despite them."
1723,"I think you've never written software and have unrealistic expectations of software developers, plus an underestimate of what Sam Altman managed to do."
1724,16 may be my last iphone
1725,Fun Fact: I didn't get any Apple AI ads. The Advertisment AI knew I would shit on it hard ^^
1726,"Simple fix: Fire Federighi, beg Forstall to come back."
1727,"Shoking, apple sucks."
1728,Apple is effectively at marketing . Nothing revolutionary about apple ðŸŽ
1729,The open source software for AI is available; they just need to use it
1730,"moved to andriod just before apple ai, couldnt be happier with an andriod and feel like i dodged a bullet with the iphone 16"
1731,"People mistake Apple for a basic commodity-selling company, but that is completely false. Apple, as it stands, is a luxury consumer brand selling prestige points to feed your ego. They don't even hide this in their marketing strategy, it's a brand that you're buying, not a device."
1732,"I know I'm definitely in the minority in the comments section, but having and using AI on a phone is the least of my concerns."
1733,"This CodeFusion editing seems awkward, unusual pauses that used to not be there"
1734,background Music so bad I can not listen.
1735,Apple is about to increase their price again to compensate their cock up ðŸ¤¨
1736,BTW: Which model did you use for the comics?
1737,Not just buggy. I bought an iphone 16 plus last year. The phone is super laggy and slowâ€¦ seems worse than my iphone 12. Games are a stuttery messâ€¦ this phone is super disappointing. I think I might need to go back to android
1738,"4:47 It is very apple-like to take software from superior (at least relative to its field) places. FreeBSD built Apple, I think they should give the foundation 6 trillion dollars."
1739,"Tim Cook has to go, innovation is literally nonexistent for years"
1740,"ðŸš©Stop click baiting. There is no AI failure, call translation, message translation, Image generation on device, background clearing on device, page summary, proof reading. All is AI based. The only thing pending is Siri which is in works."
1741,False promises.... sounds like elon musk.
1742,looks like its tim cooks inability to manage Apple
1743,"â€œAsk Siri something complicatedâ€ my man, it canâ€™t even find half of the music in my library and the other half is severely temperamental."
1744,"I set the charging to 80% and in some cases, it still charges to 100%.  My MacPro is bricked after an OS update"
1745,I think you don't know what The Onion is if you think that that was not a legit summary of The Onion article.
1746,Apple pulled an Elon Musk.
1747,Another quality production  ðŸ‘Œ
1748,"Well balanced video. It's good to see such channels now calling out all tech companies as things are.  
Apple had been shielded for to long by many which probably has let them get away with so much"
1749,"""rare"""
1750,I'm glad they haven't done well with AI. I don't want AI forced into my phone and life. I'm very against AI use and also don't like the idea of something having all my info then suggesting stuff for me.
1751,"The problem is Apple keeps ignoring its customers regarding Siri and focuses on secondary gimmicks like Genmoji.
They tell us that the new Siri doesnâ€™t meet their quality expectations for release but theyâ€™re happy to continue with an existing product thatâ€™s frustrating to use at best and woefully inept at its worst. Siri canâ€™t even answer the most basic queries, meanwhile its competitors are years ahead in capability. 
Listening to Craig F et al recently, they seem either completely unaware or they just donâ€™t care what Apple customers want Siri to be: a useful, reliable, accurate personal assistant."
1752,A Company that spends all its time virtue signalling about saving the environment while coming up with innovative ways to make independent repairs impossible.. No surprise that it is struggling to innovate where it matters.
1753,"Apple manipulate loyal customers into buying new products with lies that run for years, while other brand devices many many years old get added abilities Apple might get in many years to come.
If you're ok with this behaviour keep giving them your money. ðŸ¤£
Apple Stockholm Syndrome is real."
1754,"No real softwar developers.

The true fallout of the world's lack of competent software developers has yet to reveal itself. Money is simply not a good enough incentive to turn people into good engineers. You have to be born for that, so that you become good in it for the fun of it. The real amount of software developers in industry should be cut dramastically, and replaced with those few who have the desire and skill. But this would cause just more unimployment, which the society cannot handle."
1755,"I have both Samsung and Apple, and yes Apple AI is lagging behind Samsung by a huge margin."
1756,"4:48 Borrowing someone else's tools, isn't that very Apple like? Like the GUI from Xerox?"
1757,0:37 that third screenshot is funny... i member way back in school being forced read apple design language/documentation for mobile because we were going to get one random question from it that counted for 20% of the grade. and many years later we have that third screen from the same company. its like someone pitched them concept art and they just said yes and used it as is.
1758,Background music in this video is too loud distracting while trying to listen
1759,In 2025 apple introduces a new skin as the biggest innovation. How the great have fallen
1760,"Not gonna lie, the last Apple product I ever owned was an iPhone 3 and I am glad I never touched a ""i"" product ever again."
1761,They got rid of the person who had any idea about AI and how to integrate it.
1762,"So, Apple basically turned into Microsoft. 

Ironic."
1763,"Far too soon to call, like their Maps app. Writing good software is a time consuming process because it's necessarily so iterative involving testing."
1764,I think they cornered themselves when they made privacy the central part of their marketing. Now they are stuck running on device ai models instead of the cloud which are subpar. They also have a lot less data to feed the  models compared to the competition also because of their privacy policies. Those features should have never been announced as this was predictable.
1765,"They poured 10 billion into the Apple Car and then cancelled it entirely, meanwhile AI was taking over and Apple decides to....wait and see?

1769,"They poured 10 billion into the Apple Car and then cancelled it entirely, meanwhile AI was taking over and Apple decides to....wait and see? 
Im sorry but this is not simply a mistake, its complete mismanagement."
1770,"Because AI is overhyped, but so many delusional analysts on wall street"
1771,"Apple would not be the first company that once was an absolute powerhouse but failed to innovate or just hasnâ€™t adapted in time to a changing environment and  new trends: Kodak, RIM, Nokia, Yahoo, Blockbuster, Xerox, MySpace, Commodore, Polaroid, Toshiba, Palm, Pan Am, Atari, AOLâ€¦

95% of new features for iPhones and iOS are these days completely useless to me. Gimmicks. I spend more time in figuring out how to disable those new nonsense features on my phone than using those 5% features that at least seem to have some use cases on paper. Apple focuses too much on new designs than on new features. Reminds me of all those redesigns of webpages, shops and portals during my past years in the job. With every new boss there was a redesign. Because changing the look and feel is the easiest way to show that someone did something without actually doing something.

And I never used Siri. Maybe I am paranoid or just too old. But I have like zero interest in talking to my phone."
1772,you're just gonna leave Ilya out of the open AI portion of the video?
1773,Itâ€™s time for the top two guys to retire

1775,Apple desperately needs Soundhound AI technology
1776,"Latest iOS release 18.5 is full of bugs. Phone freezes, some features work on second try. Total garbage. Not sure if Samsung any better either."

1778,Always wait your mini-documentaries
1779,Rare? Almost everything that Apple did after Jobs is pretty much subpar. Cook is not a product person
1780,Apple is the new IBM.
1781,"Why is Apple's AI so important? 
Because Apple's customers are among those who need it most."
1782,"Siri was suppose to be the first product to give us the AI chat experience, at least that's what we all imagined Siri to be in the future."
1783,Will Apple be the next Blackberry?
1784,Apple said features will roll out in 2026. Not in the fall.
1785,ick: over ripen

1787,I really want a dumb phone. Iâ€™m over it.
1788,"AI in general is a big waste, good tech and it have a purpose but its only a ""fun toy"" for a normal person..  I can accept AI if i can control it, forced AI with no opt-out is a no go."
1789,Im glad that Apple choose Alibaba for its AI because its very very good. Im not an Apple user though.

1801,"Apple always does this. Advertising something they don't have, seeing how people respond and then creating the product (instead of advertising a product they already have). Just that this time, they couldn't deliver so they got ""caught"". But it's widely know that apple first advertises, and then makes the product after. Ever since the Machintosh"

1803,"Okay, I don't think you have understood the issue correctly. The only thing that did miss the deliverable was Siri integration with  App Intent and multi-modal connectivity, but that has yet to be delivered today by all of the so called AI leader's.

1820,I like Apple because it keeps other companies on their toes and I hope they catch up soon. The closest I've come to owning an Apple device was an iPOD for myself and an iPAD for my son
1821,Weâ€™re in the era where Apple moves from â€œproducts Steve worked on but didnâ€™t finishâ€ to â€œproducts without vision & direction by Steveâ€
1822,This is extremely damning

Siri under Ian Rockwell's leadership is in the best hands and will come good imo. He's been known to be very critical of Siri and the path it's team were lead down. Even proposing a new voice assistant / Siri overhaul when developing the Vision Pro, as he saw it as a central way to control the device."
1824,"11:58, and they got that nickname because they were the AI/LM division AI/MLess  ðŸ˜‚"
1825,"I bought an iPhone because people told me ios was smooth and intuitive. 

Spoiler : its the complete opposite. 

Every single app has a different way of dealing with the keyboard, I mean on android thereâ€™s a â€œhide keyboardâ€œ button. On iOS you have to use that stupid gesture that works differently on every single app or donâ€™t even work at all. The keyboard itself sucks, no numbers on the main keyboard, no clipboard, prediction is horrible in my language, you canâ€™t even change the size.

The settings are all over the place, it took me 30min and a Reddit post to finally found â€œauto brightnessâ€œ which is in the accessibility settings and not inside the brightness settings for some reasons. (Not even in the control center)

Why do I have to swipe when faceid sees me, just unlock the phone already. Speaking about faceid, it works great but I donâ€™t need to see that useless lock icon animation every time I use it. 

No universal back gesture, some app allow it some donâ€™t. 

90% of the time when I use the back gesture on safari to go to the previous page, nothing load and I have to start all over again. 

You canâ€™t even change your ringtone without having to almost hack the phone, just let me download a song from YouTube and set it as a ringtone. 

Customization is basically changing the colors of the icons and the wallpaper. Incredible ðŸ˜.

Why is there so much wasted space between the dock and the first row of icons?

If I donâ€™t need the widget â€œpageâ€œ on my home screen, I mean the one on the left side, just let me delete it. 

Swiping down for the control center works smoothly but not the notification screen. 

The cameras are not good at all, itâ€™s only decent because apps are optimized for iPhone. But if you look at the raw picture of an iPhone against any Android flagship, the iPhone one looks like shit. 

iPhones users always say that I will get use to it, but to me itâ€™s like punching someone in the face until he likes it. 
Yeah I will eventually get use to it, but not because I want to but because iOS force me to. 

The only things I like are faceid and being able to connect to any website with my Apple account in 10sec. 

Canâ€™t wait to switch back to Android, and I just touched the tip of the iceberg iOS is even worse than that."

1827,"Apple just needs to let Siri take over the operating system and track users' behaviors and patterns to be more useful in predicting what the user will want/need. Let the phone know everything about the user to allow for a deep personal, unique user experience, and you have a homerun Apple Intelligence product. They have the resources, they can do it, they just need a little imagination and release from old ways. You're welcome, Apple. I just solved Apple Intelligence for you. Have fun ruling the world! âœŒï¸"
1828,let me guess they took off the page from the CCP
1829,"I think you're wrong about one thing: making buttons look like transparent lenses is highly skeuomorphic.

1831,"Apple back then was not woke, they focus on fixing , refine existing features. That it what make users feel good even though the features they are using is not new but they know they are using a better, premium version of that feature. 
Now Apple is too busy making rainbow everything ðŸ˜¸"

1837,"Haha, Apple turns into Nokia"
1838,"I carry an iPhone 15 Pro Max and a Pixel 7 Pro. Google's assistant in 2021 was light years ahead of what Siri can do today. Maybe it will be better when the 17 is released, but I'm not holding my breath ðŸ˜"
1839,WHY do people keep treating it like a failure instead of what it really is: deceptive advertising? The FTC should be looking into this and fining Apple. The fact that theyâ€™re still proudly advertising this is really disgusting and insulting.
1840,Im still just waiting for Apple to build a working search feature in the settings app.

1844,"I switched to android, because of Apples management of its upgrades, android phones have far far better cameras for example. I went from 1 48mp camera to 3 50mp cameras for 50% of the cost of an iphone 16 pro max. My android has 6 times telephoto zoom and 3 times telephoto zoom and a 50mp wide angle lens - Much betterâ€¦."
1845,DEI results
1846,Tim Cook is simply a steward of Steve Jobâ€™s vision to make sure he can operationally provide enough revenue to keep Apple going with their current product line for as long as possible. There will be no new products that will change the industry. Another 5 years Apple will become an HP.
1847,"Steve Jobs was unique and an icon of mine, when he died part of Apple died with him thus losing its magic."
1848,Iâ€™ve only ever had iPhone since it first came out. If Apple really end up dropping the ball on AI Iâ€™d consider moving away from them. Itâ€™s going to be that important.
1849,Itâ€™s not just apple thatâ€™s having this problem . Most of the big tech companies are having this problem. So begins the fall.
1850,"Apple is becoming â€œanalogâ€ in super digital ecosystem. AI is category on its own and its tentacles are reaching to every corner of our lives. Itâ€™s not an iPhone or computer sitting on a table, nor design. AI requires its own strategy and Apple should not apply here what they used to in the past. AI will soon affect our jobs, economy and everything else the way how it all accelerates. This is very different situation and Apple will pay for their ignorance if they will not do something drasticâ€¦.shame though"
1851,"I will continue watching in spoty, I forgot you guys were there, cheers!"
1852,"They have billions of $. Th EU could have hired programmers to build it or just buy AI startup like chatGPT, or form some deal like Microsoftâ€™s. This is simply embarrassing"
1853,"I definitely think it was a painful lesson learnt for Apple. You saw them being extremely cautious during WWDC25.
The reality is Apple is here for the long game, so they'll be behind at times and ahead at times, but they're always in the game. While they're behind right now, I also don't think they need to be the end all and be all when it comes to AI. Just as they never intended to compete with Google on search, they don't intend to compete with OpenAI with a chatbot. However, they are delivering platform tools that will let developers build amazing apps upon Apple's platforms."
1854,"Hmmm, I'm remembering Nokia for some reason"
1855,The fall finally begins?
1856,"Disaster is rather overblown. Who cares. Neither Apple nor Google include, or as you put it with Gemini ""build-in"" these things in their devices, they send data to be processed in some  datacenter.

I agree Siri is getting downright stupid. I pulled away from Apple's services several years ago, and a bit out of frustration with the newer overcomplicated locked down and much slower macOS, I asked Siri for some random thing I knew it was capable of doing since the Sierras; it offered me a f**king web search. Then told me ""that's not nice"" at my response to that.

Google should also be sued for false advertising since everything included in their devices is not ""included"" per se, it requires accepting a privacy agreement because it needs to send data to Google. Everything. Even the phone appâ€¦on a phone. It doesn't have nearly a passionate culâ€” fanbase as Apple's though."
1857,"Why would they get someone responsible for the ""Vision Pro"" to take over?  The Vision Pro was a failure."
1858,"1:12 how about tesla's full self driving autopilot ?

We're waiting since 2017 . That's almost ten years . 10 years ..."
1859,"Sorry Dagogo but I think you miss the most important thing: as you said yourself, apple was never 'first'. They would never rush the market. But this AI boom was just too big and it was The Thing (still is) and like it or not they *had* to participate. It was too much pressure to bear and to answer why you don't have anything. So they just didn't have their usual 3-4 year period which they take to develop something. I'm still sure they didn't want to do this, but they just had no choice left"
1860,Lol. Apple has been failing for decades. They just have a braindead fanbase that'll buy their products just because it has a fruit stamped on them
1861,"literally every online intelligence model is gimped
when you run an offline LLM, its like drinking ice water when you've been fed from a dung well before

Apple was never going to be able to do this, even though the AI revolution had been coming for years"
1862,Guess who has a sate of the art AI lying around and saved Apple once?!
1863,I had Apple everything up to the iPhone 6 or maybe 6s. It was buggy apps didn't work correctly and I switched to Android and got rid of everything I owned up until last year with my MacBook hanging on. I'm on a Chromebook now pixel phone and you don't need anything else.
1864,"Hahaha, do one about Tesla's complete false advertising... Where's the consequences? This is America, there are no consequences"
1865,"Imagine having trillions of dollars and still picking and choosing which tech to invest in.
If i had that much money, i would be pioneering tech, investing in everything secretly and pushing out products.
Even if i had to make a sperarr brand to just show off the new tech and experiment.
Tim Cook didn't do much for Apple.
He reaped the benefits given to him by Steve and image made by Steve.
Apple is still knows because of Steve."

1872,now they moved onto inventing windows vista
1873,"The problem with Apple Intelligence is that it's trying to run an LLM directly on the phone instead of in the cloud. If users expect it to match or outperform cloud-based models with over 600 billion parameters, that's unrealistic â€” mobile chips just aren't there yet."

1878,"Nonsense video, basically all you're saying is ""last year didn't work, competition was here before"" - Apple is way behind on real world application of AI, but opening models to developers and running them locally is huge, huge benefit to devs. You're observing WWDC as if it's an iphone keynote launch from 15 years ago and pushing out content with effectively no information at all"
1879,"there's nothing wrong in having two AI teams â€” google has multiple, that's why their models are all over the place and you can see it's clearly different products under one umbrella. they are all made separately as to not put all eggs in one basket"
1880,Never had a issue with my apple AI so idk what yâ€™all are experiencing
1881,Apple is the Intel now
1882,"If prime steve jobs alive. 

Siri would be the chatgpt even before chatgpt becomes chatgpt."
1883,Their OS updates over the past 3 years have been so buggy that theyâ€™ve negated any productivity gains from new features which most of them are badly implemented anyway.
1884,"If they can sue Apple for vaporware.... There should be a class action for Tesla's ""Full"" ""Self"" Driving ðŸ™„"
1885,Apple should just buy Openai
1886,I just installed the dev beta for iOS 26 and hot takeâ€¦ itâ€™s bad. Contrast issues galore and distracting visuals that donâ€™t really contribute to usability. Add on convoluted new nav patterns and this release is bound to be more controversial than iOS 7.
1887,"They should've silently cancelled it then at WWDC address the rumors and say ""no, we're not making an AI model because machines aren't our customers. You are. You, the creative minds that made us who we are."" They would've gotten so much positive praise for that. But no, they chased the shareholders and the AI bubble, and are now paying the price for it since they fumbled the bag so hard"
1888,"""You can't just promise something and not deliver, that's illegal."" Elon says hold my beer."
1889,they are too busy doing stock buybacks rather than r&d
1890,"DEI, obviously"
1891,I think Apple has been declining in innovation after Steve Jobs passed away and his innovations ran out. The people that took over from Steve Jobs are not as innovative and are driving innovation as Apple should.
1892,"Wow... sounds like Jobs took more from Atari than we first thought. Atari had a history of having competing internal diviisions, too."
1893,They were so far ahead under Steve Jobs that the momentum has allowed them to keep ahead so far. But other companies have outdne them for a long time and your stsrting to see the result.
1894,"I was one of the first to try ChatGPT and Adobeâ€™s crap.
I donâ€™t bother with AI anymore because it keeps lying to me with stuff that doesnâ€™t exist.
Need a source article that doesnâ€™t exist? Generative AI will generate one for you.


The more time goes by, the more I wish I could return to the 80s/90s where the internet was confined to one computer in the corner of a room.
But no, society demands what it considers progress. Canâ€™t even go to a restaurant today unless you can scan a QR code."
1895,"Watching this on my iPhone 

Thatâ€™s why Apple wins. I donâ€™t need more shitty AI images."
1896,"ðŸ˜‚ they can't even get Siri speak.
For every question, it asks me to read the web search result"
1897,"I think this failure will actually be their biggest win long term. Consumers donâ€™t want 99% of the AI bullshit companies are jamming down their throats right now.

When the dust settles and we figure what AI is actually good for at the consumer level, Apple wonâ€™t have wasted billions trying to find out and can copy what users actually want."
1898,"ironically, one of Apple's two  innovation over the last 10-15 years was the Vision VR which failed massively. The other one being their silicon and ARM adaptation - which rocks.

I think they intended to be a bit more successful in popularity with the vision, but the product stopped existing 2 weeks after release in the general public. Meanwhile the term ipod is still used for mp3 players.
I've never liked apple but the products of the 2000s were amazing for the average consumer. but after the Iphone 5, they sat down and did nothing.
What iOS does today, is what Android could do literally almost 15 years ago. And y'all can't say it is more userfriendly when literally the only thing that matters for user experience 101 is missing (A CONSISTENT BACK BUTTON)."
1899,Steve Jobs must be kicking in his grave rn

1903,"Calling it ""Ai"" was the first blunder."
1904,love my Pixel 9 Pro
1905,The difference with Apple's AI is that they are trying to do it on-device. It's going to be so much more difficult to handle AI on device and Apple is leading the way there.
1906,They started hiring only soy devs and not based giga chad C engineers
1907,"Dissapointed, unsuscribed...."

1909,"This is beyond shocking! That a company with this much power and cash, can screw this up for so long, while the world passes them by is beyond belief!

I think the problem is that theyâ€™re complacent but also that AI is totally outside their comfort zone. Their strength is in designing beautiful UIâ€™s while AI completely abstracts the UI and does things for you. Once it gets sufficiently sophisticated, UIâ€™s are just irrelevant, you never even see them."
1910,".....and, apple gave up on a car after spending $billions and years.   ....apple spends too much time on woke DEI and rainbows.   ....get beck to work and fix Siri !"

1915,They didnâ€™t launch AI. They launched an idea and hoped no one noticed.

1922,"Apple makes products that ""just work.""  AI is not up to the reproducibility and predictability that I think Apple wants."
1923,"""Yep, Apple had two competive AI-teans, inside the same company!""
Yep, that's in the spirit of Steve Jobs.
iPhone was developed in the same manor. Steve Jobs had 2 teams competing around the developement of the iPhone.
So nothing new under the sun. It's the Apple style!"
1924,Sounds so similar to promising a self-driving car and never delivering it.  Without the class action lawsuit.
1925,"Without Steve Jobs, Apple is just a mediocre tech company."

1927,"12:15 - downplayed chatgpt and its usefulness, how familiar! So Apple is the new Nokia / blackberry?"
1928,Apple should just bring out a a companion that is extremely human and not that acurate
1929,"My theory: Apple is usually late to the party with some features, but when they bring them they're usually more refined/polished and improved in some way. They tried to implement LLM's but couldn't get it to meet Apple's standards for performance and consistency. Idk just based on Apple's history, resources, talent, etc. I'm not sure I buy ""well they're just too dumb to figure out Ai.""

I dont even think it's reasonable to assume LLM's are the future of Ai since they're just the first really usable versions of this. But I do think that all the companies involved are trying to milk LLM's for all their worth until then."

1940,"I have used ""okay Google"" or whatever it's official called, for years. ""Gemini"" replaced it during a software update. And then NONE of the functionality worked. ""Read my last text"" turned into a novel about texts - not the actual text message. 

I then asked it to give back my assistant and it gave me a page and a half about it being a chat bot and can't do anything

Took my over 15min to figure out how to get my Google Assistant back. 

We've had this function for years and years. My Google Assistant isn't perfect, but it works to tell me the weather and check my calendar"
1941,"apple doesn't learn from past mistakes, it has been shipping shit products for ever, do we notice because we are used to perfection or do other companies do the same ?
anyway I think that they should have done just like with CPU, use third parties until they build their own"
1942,"4:43 ""Not only did Apple show up late, but it showed up late and borrowed other people's tools. Not very Apple like"" - Actually, that's VERY much like Apple. They take other tech and 'prettify' it. Rarely do they truly innovate the tech.  They copy.  That's why they're often late. It takes time for new tech to mature and for them to copy it. They also 'borrowed':
* The GUI (from Xerox, 11 years late) 
* The Mouse (also from Xerox, 16 years late), 
* Smartphone (5 years late), 
* Tablets (10 yeaars late), 
* Voice assistant (3 years late),
* Bluetooth wireless Earbuds (9 years late),
* Mobile payments (3 years late),
* Smart watches (3 years late),
* MP3 players (4 years late). 

Not saying they don't do a great job at it. They're attacking it from a consumer design & usability POV But let's not pretend it's always on the cutting edge of innovation. It's their marketing department who fools the Apple fanboys into thinking they are. They piss on them, and tell them it's raining (see Apple Intelligence)."
1943,Siri barely works and canâ€™t do basic tasks offline and half the time it doesnâ€™t even hear what you say properly and will do an entirely different task.
1944,"Apple without Jobs is not the same. And it shows. Just like that time, when he was ousted form the company."
1945,"""Rare Failure""?
Apple never had a search engine and now you're pretending like they need to whip up a Google in 18 months. What they are doing is building AI/ML features into their apps - they've been doing that forever.

They DID as Federghihi about the demos and he claimed they did them, and they were real. You're straight up lying in this video."
1946,Overvalued company fails to add overrated feature ðŸ˜±ðŸ¥±

1961,"Instead of Apple killing off iPod Touch and gently phasing it out, they should have done it to Siri. iPod Touch has always been popular among youth, and it helps get youth hooked and eventually graduate to iPhone as adolescents."
1962,Apple should buy Perplexity
1963,"Using AI â€œartâ€? come on, Cold Fusion, youâ€™re better than this - and certainly can afford to hire real artists."
1964,"Siri needs to be ditched entirely, but Apple seem to be suffering from sunk cost fallacy."
1965,Can't stay on top forever
1966,"IMHO, a large amount of the issues ï£¿ has with moving forward and adopting new tech is due to the culture of â€œprivacyâ€ they are trying to hold onto. Of course privacy in todayâ€™s world is an illusion, but ï£¿ strives to hold onto that as a marketing pitch rather than doing what other companies do which is blur the line and distract with features that outplay any notion of privacy. So, I think what weâ€™ll see going forward is ï£¿ finally capitulating to save face and save share holders, ultimately becoming something that Steve Jobs never wanted, but must become in order to compete. Either that, or the era of ï£¿ is over. Weâ€™ll see."
1967,Apple ran of all the ideas ðŸ˜…
1968,Apple should just ditch Siri and its stupid AI tools and work with google in integrating google AI suits into their system
1969,ios such a joooooke
1970,"What a shame, A.I. is going to bring them down. Itâ€™s kryptonite to the closed garden."
1971,"Apple is going down to shit. I repair phones for a living. Apple hardware is becoming garbage. I see all kind of failures, especially logic board and battery issues."
1972,Why use those 4 ridiculously large black microphones? Ha
1973,"all these tricks like ""what are the headphones he is wearing"", are working only because of massive human training that ""AI"" industry constantly hides. They want us to believe that the LLM figured it out. Absolutely not. It was all hand-trained to perfection and algorithms were custom written behind the scenes. LLMs were used to understand what the user wanted and to produce the final answer. But everything else is hand-trained. And that is why it will be very difficult for anybody to replicate."
1974,"Apple was always slow in adapting new features & technologies. They wait until they mature. In the AI case, though, this backfired."
1975,Cook is a beancounter. He kept apple alive after the death of the emperor. But being good at managing a company doesn't mean he has a vision. That's the difference..
1976,1:04 tell that to Elon musk. The vaporware king
1977,"Apple considers its users idiots, and to some extent, they are. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£"
1978,"The iPad was the only major functionality upgrade in WWDC2025. All the rest got cosmetic features, like the liquid glass or a new numbering system. But functionality remained the same for most devices... which was rather underwhelming. It is sad to see that the management at Apple have failed to innovate, if anything, they seem to be ""unnovating"", moving backwards. Let hope the class action suits will be the cold water to make them wake up and move into a better and strategic direction."
1979,"I tried a apple phone, personal opinion they are over hyped by marketing,  FOMO drives the sheep to purchase the products, allegedly a greedy sneaky company that doesn't want their products to be fixed cheaply. i will stick with android BUT graphene OS is worth investigating, pity it can't be flashed to a variety of brands, Nothing seems ok but is just basic."
1980,To me what is more disturbing ist that as a user you have no control over turning the AI functions on or off...
1981,"Apple is effectively locked in own success. They don't move forward, they rehash, so they do utmost to win Doctorow prize. Their ecosystem and target group are now liability.  They could give us XXIst century Unix workstation with clean desktop - they choose not to. Apple has money, talent, hardware and data to make either AI or anything else success. They just choose not to.  Maybye even they no longer can innovate new products, they just upgrade and maintain.  Apple started planting Neural Engine to hardware and SDK long before people realized. 4:44 - not a problem. First iPhone had Yahoo Mail and Google Maps."
1982,"apple garbage will be soon history. They have no no product or any vision what next. They never ever will get 6G chips, the next gen wireless. The current one what they use is pure garbage"
1983,"you did not call AI development ""open"", LMAO"
1984,"I don't think Mac has made real computers for 10 years, these things are impossible to develop on"
1985,Theyâ€™re still a primarily hardware company
1986,"Steve said, ""Ideas must always win."" To make a good product, they have to take the time to fight opinions as if they were polishing the raw stone. They should not forget the spirit of ""Think different."""
1987,Apple's Nokia moment.
1988,Ya the guy who delivered the vision pro will save you. That overpriced forehead brick was revolutionary haha
1989,"0:42 - I love that quote. ""Apple has started to over rippen."""
1990,"If Jobs were alive, Tim Cook would of been fired long time ago."
1991,"To be fair, Tucker would probably claim that a demon urinated on him in his sleep. Good prediction models there."
1992,"Dude, a suggestion, don't use that comic book AI crap... Hire an artist or get some stock footage. It also cheapens the story"
1993,Sheep never really question anything. They're fine.
1994,The first thing I do when I get a new iPhone is disable Apple Intelligence.
1995,First world problems.. Siri not working properly.! ðŸ˜•
1996,"less AI has just made them more appealing to me, not all of us want AI, or voice assistants or any of that rubbish period."
1997,"Apple never had good software or great design. Remember iTunes? Skeuomorphic design? Single button mouse? A perfectly round mouse? What they did well was the walled garden, making sure Apple items work well with Apple items."
1998,"The only reason why Apple was very successful because of Steve Job, after he died there's no more innovation, they only improving the existing technology."
1999,Market it - and they will buy.
2000,Rare failure?  Apple software has been garbage forever.
2001,"In my view these concepts need to be backed up by proven demonstrable science and a developed software product.  In my experience these AI extensions appear to be flakey and introduce their own errors which could easily be missed.

I view these companies are using users to debug their software.  They are experimenting using the user base as Guinea pigs."
2002,It's all so tiresome
2003,Female NASA engineer.  Lel.
2004,AI being forced down our throats isn't a new thing. It should be an option not a requirement!
2005,I only updated to the 16 for apple intelligenceâ€¦ and siri has just gotten dumber since I got the phone
2006,"Im new here, what can android do that apple intelligence canâ€™t do? Isnâ€™t it just hinged on the api?"
2007,Rare? Apple has been trash for a while now.
2008,"Apple Intelligence is a perfect example of why switching to pre-recorded keynotes was one of Appleâ€™s worst decisions. The shift made it easy for them to get comfortable and start over promising because thereâ€™s no pressure to prove anything live. Back when keynotes were live, they had to deliver real demos on stage, which pushed their teams to make the impossible actually happen."

2013,"Apple and companies like it seem more focused on control and profit than truly elevating people. Whether they grow or crash, it doesnâ€™t change their stance toward the average user: you're a data point, not a priority. Investing emotional energy in them, getting frustrated by their moves... itâ€™s starting to feel like a waste. Better to focus on things that actually empower you, not just serve their bottom line."
2014,Wanna see buggy sw...have a look at the pixel phones! Jeeeeeesus
2015,Why everyone hating. Glass OS gonna be lit. Combining software and hardware to give better visuals . Almost as if apple wants you to see through windows of your multiple vr screens.
2016,Gay

2019,"""AAAA"" AI"
2020,"I love my Apple products and could care less about using their own AI platforms.   Iâ€™ll just keep using Grok, chatgpt or deepseek.

Maybe this was their thinking over there.  To keep sellingl the hardware and let the apps do the work that the people are looking to do."
2021,I think this is more of a problem with A.I. itself. Apple doesn't want to release an embarrassing product like everyone else is doing. (Liquid Glass is kinda embarrassing though.)
2022,I clocked Apple Intellegence as bs frame 1. But their share price still surged off of the unsubstantiated hype.
2023,"a lot of Apple users dont even know, a damn shame"
2024,I laugh so much at the the Tucker Carlson message LMAO
2025,"Apple is not an AI first company. It's too early to call Apple a failure. It's like saying at Apple is a failure at search, etc... For a developer conference, they had nearly 8 million views. It's hardly a failure. At least that title gets you clicks."
2026,They just needed more DEI ?
2027,Apple? What is that? a ripoff brand? ðŸ™ƒ
2028,"Let's be real, people only buy iPhones so they don't get bullied by their ""friends"". Funnily enough, that is only a thing in America due to the blue checkmarks, the rest of the world uses Whatsapp."
2029,How did they fumble so bad? Because there wasn't another company doing this they could buy out.
2030,Heads need to roll at Apple; Tim Cook and Craig Federighi for starters.
2031,Warren Buffett sold at the right time. Whatâ€™s the worth of an innovation company if they failed to innovate?
2032,They're pulling a Trump by not admitting
2033,"""Apple usually doesn't miss"".... could there have been a worse fumble than Apple Vision Pro lol. They discontinued it in less than a year."
2034,"6:15 - I remember when I got the iPhone 4S I thought Siri was amazing and had a bright future ahead of it. Fast forward to 2025 i don't even use her anymore. When I do decide to use SIRI it ends up being a shitshow and i just open safari and search what i need lmao. 
You would think that Apple would be cooking up something good with Siri. Like the late steve said: We won't rest on our laurels (paraphrasing) - Yep APple sure did alright..."
2035,I dread every software update because it makes it worse and harder to use in some way each time
2036,Steve job can't even rest in peace
2037,At least they followed up their AI failure with a larger UI design failure.
2038,Nokia syndrome
2039,"A tech company promising something, selling their product based on the promise is illegal... or par for the course?

Ever hear of Tesla Full-Self Driving, many people even paid for it!"
2040,I was using Samsung and Pixel before moving into using iPhone in 2018. I loved Android and I think my next phone will be either a Samsung or a Pixel again.
2041,"""Tucker Carlson claims demon urinated on him while he slept, inspiring him to embrace God and read the Bible."" Peak Apple AI"

2048,"Love your channel! Appleâ€™s had some hiccups with software glitches and integrations, but every company hits rough patchesâ€”history shows it. Appleâ€™s taking its time with AI, weaving it into their ecosystem in a unique way no one else is doing. Thatâ€™s why progress feels slow; theyâ€™re redefining the game. YouTubeâ€™s flooded with bandwagon negativity, predicting Appleâ€™s doom, just like they did with Googleâ€™s search or AirPods (remember the Q-tip jabs?). These giants are too big to failâ€”they hire the worldâ€™s brightest minds to innovate. Most opinions just parrot branding and marketing hype, and the masses follow like sheep. Mark my words: Appleâ€™s AI will deliver unmatched experiences, and their stock will hit $240â€“$270 within 3 years. Keep up the awesome content! Iâ€™m a Samsung user but own some Apple productsâ€”not affiliated with them. Just my opinions, not financial advice. ( GREAT FK VIDEO AS ALWAYS }"

2057,"nah, i thikn people are finally starting to wake up. there was never a time when macOS was the better option, only a time when companies catering to creatives joined the cult. They are out now."
2058,"Regarding Appleâ€˜s failures, Iâ€™m gonna say what Steve Jobs said himself:

â€žWeâ€™re only people running this company.â€œ"
2059,3:21 he wanted to say AI but caught himself
2060,"RIP Steve. It would be awesome to see how Steve would navigate the current landscape of tech. He probably would've NAILED wearable tech. Apple Vision under steve would've brought so much fucking FOMO. He probably would've been first to jump in and embrace Web3. So many possibilities he was gone too damn soon. 

IDK if Apple will ever recover. The only tech they released that was awesome was the M-Chips. Other than that I don't even watch WWDC or keynotes anymore. Steve made those keynotes fun."
2061,Apple should accept the fact that its no longer desired product and make their phone prices non inflated.. only then it will have chance to survive.. otherwise it will be next nokia
2062,And all this mess is happening while the windows insiders program users realise that the next windows version is gonna be freaking awesome ðŸ˜‚
2063,Dead people don't come back sad ðŸ˜¢
2064,"None of this matters, Apple has iMessage, that's all that matters"
2065,"It's just paddling to investors, no actual consumer cares about AI on their phone. Couldn't give a shit about it, I disabled any Apple Intelligence features as soon as my phone got the update. Fake or not, they haven't shown anything that would be remotely interesting on my phone"
2066,"If the iPhone launch went like this, there would be no iPhone."
2067,"Like duh Apple been a complete rip off for years, selling overpriced junk.
Apple only cares about massive profits and giving the suckers/public worthless warranties."
2068,Please. Steve would have fixed it all by 2018.  Fired the bozos and had a clear but all most impossible vision of what siri is and is not.
2069,No video on veo 3 its strange ?
2070,Apple has NEVER had an original thought
2071,Cold Fusion just leveled up again ðŸ¤¯ epic production!
2072,"Tiny white text on a light gray glass background.
Illegible (but important)  small red warning text on dark gray buttons.
Just a tap? A short press, a long press, a swipe up or down or left or right?
Swipe from an edge? Swipe a control? Swipe a list? Long hold a list? Who knows?
Nothing is intuitive. Documentation and clarity of function is replaced with ""discovery"" of features.

This is what happens when you design a UI (and a company) around looking good in slick, simulated, fake video presentations.
Steve would have been pissed, thrown the phone across the room, called them D-level Bozos, and fired the lot of them.
Tim Apple, from Shipping and Receiving, simply doesn't know any better."
2073,A rare failure? How about their EV? Apple are going the way of Nokia IMHO.
2074,I really want apple  fall down so other brands stop making their products like Apple products
2075,Hard disagree - Most AI in the market is still extremely buggy beyond the vanilla use cases. Its a limitation of the technology.
2076,Nice AI video
2077,Apple should train a model on Steve Jobs and ask AI Jobs for directions ðŸ˜…
2078,My view early on was steve jobs wouldnt of allowed these failures he ruled apple with an iron first and no nonsense attitude apple was his baby as far as he was concerned and no one wad to threaten it with him gona things have failed to innovate and im not an apple fan im windows and android but from what i know about apple steve jobs was who made apple what it is
2079,They should have not gone down the rabbit hole on performative AI. It should have all been backend improvements to existing on device services.  Health.  Calendar.  Journal. Siri.  We don't need image search or generation.  We never did.  They wasted a year and so much social capital by trying to keep up with gimmicks.
2080,"I bought the first Apple Siri release, and  today Apple refuses to let me turn on the phone.  I moved to Samsung and have never looked back."
2081,Good video
2082,Gemini is so good. It feels alive.
2083,"Sounds like the problems Nokia had. I loved my windows phone. Only if they had shared the apps with google play, it might still be here."
2084,"Apple scam artists, what a shame"
2085,"TIM COOK is a great supply-chain person, but not a great PEOPLE MANAGER.  He allowed his company to fracture internally, and fosters a culture of separatism.  Unless he brings in an assistant to help him unify the companyâ€™s battling software divisions, Apple will continue to fail.  And the False advertising is shameful."
2086,"I don't like how AI focused this video is. It started out interesting, claiming that Apple software has become buggy, and then it suddenly switched to talking about nothing but AI, which plenty of people had enough of already."
2087,"Noooo Apple is not failing, they are big researchers on the field of AI. Every now and then they will publish a ""research"" that says that AI is not what we have been told it is and we should ignore it. ðŸ¤£"
2088,I am still waiting for the Apple Car from the Simpsons.
2089,"Apple's current executives are too old to understand recent AI, there is no way out as Cook and his inner circle are clinching to power as hard as possible, like Putin and Xi."

2094,"Tim must go, Steve wouldâ€™ve never allow this to happen"
2095,Apple customers are marketing victims.
2096,A sign of things to come! Hubris stifled imagination and led to a culture of stagnation.
2097,"Tim Cook is to Apple what Steve Ballmer was to Microsoft. And, arguably, he is even worse. Ballmer ""only"" missed the Smartphone. Cook already missed Autonomous Cars, AR/VR and AI. I give him a year."

Steve was so ahead of his time that apple has been surviving on the legacy Steve left behind.

It's only a matter of time til apple crashes, burn to ashes."
2102,"Apple's future under Tim Cook is cooked (pun intended). They're just banking on the cult like following of customers they've locked into their ecosystem. Apple rarely innovates these days, and their complicity is now showing."

2117,So innovation is not their forte.
2118,Tim Coook did not cook. Now he's cooked.
2119,"AI will be part of every IaaS bundle, so everyone will be able to spin their AI service. It's not Apple's main market, but they'll implement it efficiently once AI is market ready."
2120,"Which startup company has the resources to start an Open AI system? It's mostly multi-billion-dollar companies and governments, and they are not going to sell to Apple. So Apple will be 3 years behind the rest."
2121,i miss steve.... I MISS STEVE!!!!
2122,"I bet if another Windows phone gets released, it would be the end of the iPhone!"
2123,Steve Jobs would just fire several people once he saw it was not gonna make it on deadline. Now though we have a Woke CEO and yes the company is soon over and forgotten just like Nokia...
2124,Failure of leadership even though Apple never has any shortage of cash.
2125,"Don't you worry buddy, there are enough hardcore fanboys out there that will keep Apple running for many years to come....if your brain tells you it's ok to spend 1500$ on a phone...you're a special kind of person!!! ðŸ˜‰"

2130,"i always hated mac OS and iOS, i cant even unlock or leave an app on an iphone from others because it is that poorly designed"
2131,Skeuomorphism is what they had in iOS 1-6. Was this put together by Appleâ€™s AI? ðŸ˜…
2132,"This was Predictable failure. Apple is not as good of a tech company then people think. For example what is the last thing Apple created, the I-phoneðŸ˜‚. It's been almost 2 decades and they haven't made anything new in the market."
2133,Jesus the music.  What are you trying to do with it?
2134,11:05 i still have to yell HEY GOOOGLEEE!!!
2135,"Subpar offshore resourcing combined with unrealistic investor expectations, unrealistic deadlines, and corporate enshittification. Itâ€™s destroying our economy."
2136,Apple was never a company that inovated technology they inovated w.r.t design. Thats why they dont do well with AI.
2137,"Honestlyâ€¦ does it matter?

I havenâ€™t heard of a single killer app for AI yet.  None.  Not one.  Yes, you can do some cool gimmicks but thereâ€™s still AI options on Apple devices.

I just donâ€™t see what it really matters right now."
2138,The music is making me laugh lol like how am I supposed to take this seriously dude
2139,"What music is playing at around 0:20 and 0:30  It's amazing, anyone know what it is?"
2140,Steve used to pit teams against each others all the time
2141,"I think Apple gambled with the introduction of the iPhone, I think Apple also gambled with Apple Intelligence,   They were able to make the iPhone work.  Obviously not with Apple Intelligence.  Personally, I don't know what I am missing with AI.  I do like Google AI quick summary (any summary features) of a search, but other than that . . . I really don't understand what the big deal with AI is."
2142,Failure? They didnt say they were trying to make a chatbot.
2143,Why did you show a picture of Cue about Williamson?
2144,"@ColdFusion I hate it so much that it isn't said enough the bit where OpenAI breakthrough was research work from Google and Google's poached Engineers! Sam Altman putting it bluntly is untalented, and has a history to prove unequivocally just that."

2153,"I might as well say ""Apple died wit Steve Jobs"""
2154,Apple was good enough 5 years ago. They should have just paid off all the employees and shut the company down and moved on to the next gadget.
2155,"Iâ€™m not a fanboy, but Iâ€™ve never had any issues. I donâ€™t think Appleâ€™s in the â€œAI raceâ€ â€” theyâ€™re focused on integration, not another chatbot. Just wait. Tired of these videos missing the point. I liked this channel, but itâ€™s disappointing you fell into the same arguments as the others."
2156,if plans dont go one way infuse them
2157,Iâ€™m in Beta for iOS 26 and so far thereâ€™s been many repeatable bugs. Have not even touched Apple Intelligence. Even correcting a word with AI opened the keyboard under the comment keyboard.
2158,"Universal Control, released three to four years ago works randomly even now (so it is useless). There are many things that Apple says work, but which many many people just don't experience. Chinese phones have a better interface and muchuch better price points. I am a Mac user since 1995 and I've had enough!"
2159,This is what happens when you have business majors start running the company instead of visionaries
2160,This is what happens when you have business majors start running the company instead of visionaries

2164,"I would say THREE failures: Apple Car, Apple Maps, Apple AI."
2165,I bought a iPhone 15 pro when was lunched and now after a year I want to get rid of it. Sometimes typing is awful experience and not to mention Siri . It Doesnâ€™t worth the money spend on a thing which is no better then a 600Â£ android phone .
2166,They'll just buy a company that had AI
2167,Maybe their stubborn DEI policies played a role? ðŸ¤”
2168,O bet they used Siri to write their new software
2169,I ditched all my Apple products. I feel like I've been scammed.
2170,"One question, even before the age of LLMs, who would buy an Iphone for Siri? Nobody would, r u still thinking Apple is loosing the mobile phone market coz of LLMs?"
2171,"Iâ€™m still running iOS 17. Everyone I know that switched to iOS 18 told me they HATE it, mostly due to the stupid changes they made to the Photos app. 
The way things are going, this might be my last iPhone :/ I donâ€™t know why Apple keeps changing the software every year. Itâ€™s perfectly fine to wait 2-3 years and just release minor updates to iOS 17. The new liquid glass theme looks awful."
2172,"Like an Empire, nothing last forever. Nokia dominated the cellphone technology back then. Then the company became stagnant and was overtaken by Blackberry. Same thing happened with Blackberry. Then the company became less innovative and stagnant. Then it was overtaken by Apple. Now Apple is in the same predicament. The company becomes less innovative and being overtaken by Google and Samsung. When the company becomes so big, it collapses on its own weight."
2173,"they use Xcode, that is why"
2174,"I think the issue is that they trying to achieve privacy with LLMs.  Local LLMs just aren't there yet, but if they keep inproving, then they could win in the end,."
2175,"""not only Apple arrived late, but it showed up empty handed and borrowed someone else's tools, not very Apple like""
That is exactly very Apple like. Almost every single feature introduced as innovation in iPhones, Android phones have had for years. Just recently they introduced revolutionary feature that displays the time until full charge. I've had this feature on my very first smartphone almost 15 years ago."
2176,"STEVE JOBS WAS A VISIONARY, TIM COOK IS A BUSINESSMAN. - Thereâ€™s a big difference."
2177,"The iPhone 16 was sold on a big LIE. That lie was Apple Intelligence.

Throw in the ill-conceived Camera Control button and the iPhone 16 was also a disaster.

Now, we have stupid software updates such as Liquid Glass. I think I shall not buy any more Apple products in the future."
2178,Gemini breaks the routine shortcuts... and the new widget with multiple buttons doesn't let you use personal routines... and basically all Gemini ever did after an os update forced it on me was say it can't do things assistant did without issue.  So I figured out how to completely nuke it.
2179,"Overrated and overvalued, Apple has built its brand on marketing tech as a luxury, while they have released 3 meaningful products in their lifetime.
Microsoftâ€™s bail out of Apple was a strategic act of mutual survival, ensuring Apple remained a competitor to prevent Microsoft from being labeled a monopoly.
Apple should have went under before the release of the iPhone, but Bureaucracy would not allow it to die."
2180,"The Great Ensloppening is well underway, it's not just Apple software. Many engineers specialize on a very high level and simply lack knowledge of fundamentals related to CPU architecture and how computers actually execute commands and perform effectively. Product teams are constantly adding completely superfluous features driven purely by financial incentives, which in turn of course adds needless complexity, and most engineers don't stay on a project longer than a few years, so ownership is missing as well. AI is only adding to the slop. Most consumer applications amount to lipstick on pigs."
2181,it is by apple thing to steal someone else thing and copy for last decade they are creatively bakrtupt.
2182,Tesla has been selling vaporware for decadeâ€¦.
2183,Tesla has been selling vaporware for decadeâ€¦.
2184,"Ok dude listen, you can bash Apple for their ai slop (or lack there of) but messing with the Glass Aero? Dude why? 

Tech channel idiots really love that flat metro design that looked like crap, dont they?"
2185,"Apple operates on higher principles. It wants to bring AI features to their platforms, but not in a way that compromises security, privacy, and disregards intellectual property."
2186,"I dont think Apple being a failure it's a rare thing. It has happend a lot. Sometimes I feel like people see Apple 2025 as if it was the same company once was, like 2008, 2009. That company doenst exist anymore."
2187,"As a long time Apple opposer, it is wonderful to see this iconic symbol of technological superiority finally crumble under the weight of it's own ego.  

Much like an empire that has an effective ruler for decades, the ruler dies and is poorly replaced by a bunch of waring tribes that are all out to steal the biggest piece of the pie.  Those empires tend to crumble quickly."
2188,"Apples business model has always been about letting others innovate - and then they just copy to their own system and make it slightly better after months of observing.

But now... The world is to fast for apple and people are realizing apple is stone age"
2189,Apple probably fell to AI slop cost-cutting.
2190,"The day that AI really becomes useful to me and Apple still fails to deliver, will be the day that I'll finally switch to something else. Right now I only use generative AI a few times a month. But Apple could really help themselves by fixing their god awful Clean Up tool. It's beyond embarrassing to use."
2191,16:10 watch yo a55
2192,And what did Federighiâ€™s AI team produce? Why has Tim not lost confidence in him and his buggy software? Dude is Teflon and was the face of Apple intelligence - still comfortably employed. Thereâ€™s Appleâ€™s main software problem right there.
2193,Rare? Vision. intelligence. And now Glass. The last  3 WWDCs have headlined Apple failures.
2194,Only China is winning in all markets.
2195,Siri is a massive failure. They had the opportunity to be ahead of everyone but failed. Apple hasnâ€™t innovated the iPhone is years! The Vision Pro was a failure. Tim Cook needs to step  aside at this point and a leader with vision needs to be appointed.
2196,âœ‹ðŸ» Steve Jobs is a bit overrated ðŸ˜¬
2197,"AI is really helpful for meaningless tasks, anything truly advanced or specific you waste so much time just trying to get it to understand what you're going for. It's definitely not going anywhere, and a lot of people use it now because it's free. Not sure if the tasks it works on justifies the actual cost (consider R&D, servers, electricity, facilities, marketing). OpenAI is making 3.5B in subscriptions but lose 5B and this is after they received 10B in server execution credits from Microsoft and like 20 Billion from investors"
2198,"even if they fix theyre AI theyre innovation compare to android is garbage.  stuff android has had for years are not even yet for apple :D 
its baffling that people fork over these kinds of sums of money for those bs products."
2199,Guys have you seen the WSJ interview yet?
2200,"I am baffled that in this fraud and scam economy, when a company commits fraud and puts out scams everybody is so surprised! And what's worse AI's are all garbage scams and after billions of dollars and promise after promise it's all turned out more garbage than the shit they were trying to sell us. Like flying cars and nuclear skateboards all this AI garbage will end up in the trash bin of history. Lets all move on to the next dumpster fire!"
2201,Never touching apple. lol.
2202,"Elon Musk built Grok in a year. It is the second most widely used LLM, with an over 20% market share, behind ChatGPT, which has over 65%. Apple is just a monopoly at this point, those guys cannot build anything."
2203,At this point Iâ€™ve used iPhone ðŸ“± for 10 years Iâ€™m not moving off of it I just hope they catch up and get it right
2204,"Just look at their phones; An iPhone has a great camera, but a flagship Android is still going to kick its ass in every other way."
2205,I use Gemini and copilot
2206,I donâ€™t understand how it is a failure when the function is there?
2207,"Steve Jobs Dying was the end of Apple, Tim Cook isn't a leader, hes a follower.... No folding Devices, No innovation, no aspirations, even Honor are doing better then them...."
2208,"I am semi deep into apples ecosystem, as I have a Macbook Pro, iPhone 16 pro and airpods pro.
If there are no significant improvements pÃ¥ Siri and AI, my next tech purchase is aimed to break out of the apple ecosystem."
2209,Apple have also released two papers to date downplaying AI and large language models and their ability to actually reason. That also might have something to do with it and should have been included in this video.
2210,I love the new UI design though.
2211,"Apple needs another Snow Leopard moment, just do a big release that just fixes stuff. Then go on from there."
2212,CrApple and intelligence is an oxymoron
2213,Apple is underhated
2214,this is sounding very reminiscent of nokia a few years ago
2215,https://youtu.be/ymeUDZ0MWaM?si=Z3Ly8luiJlFAveOI
2216,"While most of the comments are true everybody keeps forgetting how apple silicon M chips changed the whole industry. The fact is they can't be THE BEST at everything, hardware and software, nobody can."
2217,"While most of the comments are true everybody keeps forgetting how apple silicon M chips changed the whole industry. The fact is they can't be THE BEST at everything, hardware and software, nobody can."
2218,"Google/alphabet really invest in real research, AI and quantum computing as examples.. Apple has always been a designer hardware company, selling overpriced products to fan boys. The only time I felt it had any lead in better technology was after the launch of the first iPhone, they put together a nice product, but competitors quickly caught up."
2219,Rare failure?  It's not a stretch to consider the company's offerings as 3 big hits interrupting a 4 straight decade run of failure
2220,Too early to tell anything still
2221,Apple excelled when they did less things but very well. They have grown very big. The Siri/assistant/AI part was always a difficult point for them that they never addressed properly. If Steve Jobs was around he would have properly managed to get the right people in the right roles to make sure they build what they need. But not with the current management.
2222,"13:30 Apple is suffering from a decade of DEI management, no excuses for this ðŸ’© from trillion dollar company that charges premium prices, magic of Apple ecosystem â€œeverything is supposed to just workâ€"
2223,I own an iPhone 14 Pro and an iPhone 16 and I couldn't care less about Apple Intelligence. Apple's clearly not there yet. They sold the iPhone with Apple Intelligence while it wasn't even available in the EU when the phone was released.
2224,"Apple products are a scam, I have said this a long time ago, people who buy Apple products do not know the meaning of value, to them value is something foreign. 

but I give it to Apple they have milked people for many yearsâ€¦ ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜"
2225,apple has always been crap at software
2226,Apple is busy making glass uiðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
2227,iphone is going to be the next Nokia
2228,"Apples UI has lost its perfected magic.. also yes I do get glitches and Siri sounding slow & robotic, happens a lot when using airpods."
2229,Apple had early advantage to ai and completely fumbled as did Google.
2230,16:24 Sounds like aqua design language ðŸ¤¨ from 25 years ago but with glass
2231,Nothing lasts forever and every dominant company has a point when the downfall starts.
2232,"Bump on the row. We all know it. Apple has pride (furthermore, they need to get their shit together) and if not better than competition's models, at least will work as advertised (which should be great)."
2233,"Before apple products were pricey but you got the highest quality product on the market. Now if you own an iPhone it is a statement about you, it says you have money(or borrowed money) but not because you are clever, you are willing to pay more for less, you are the type that can be tricked and ripped off."
2234,"Apple thrived until the AI boom by focusing on refining existing features and presenting them as innovations. However, this strategy faltered with AI, as simply adapting others' advancements isn't feasible, leading them to hit a wall."
2235,"Apple Intelligence is a hard trick to pull, I can understand some shortcomings in that. The new UI which is totally unreadable and appears super-cluttered? There is no f'ing excuse for that, especially when you cannot change the UI like in Android."
2236,Apple got too big. Itâ€™s all about social justice and inferior products now.
2237,Cook needs to be out!
2238,"Damn, the first clip of the guy talking about Apple being buggy, my old phone works better than this latest one, I havenâ€™t seen more glitches in iPhone than the last two years."
2239,"These days promises are never delivered especially in vehicles electronics or contracts liabilities It's always one-sided. 
So the only promise is a promise that can be broken"
2240,Apple not so intelligent
2241,"This narrative is so distorted and I canâ€™t believe ColdFusion got on this bandwagon. Literally EVERYTHING Apple announced last year was delivered. Except Siri contextual actions. Siriâ€™s voice speech was improved (delivered) and it implemented ChatGPT (delivered). Some tech YouTubers started to say tha Apple was behind in AI mainly because Siri isnâ€™t conversational, but Apple NEVER promised that. Like EVER. Also, contextual Siri was delayed, not cancelled and although I was also disappointed by this, I noticed ALL other AI apps are available on all Apple devices and I can do everything I need. So this narrative needs to be changed. Itâ€™s just wrong to claim so based on what they promised."
2242,Getting Nokia-d
2243,Apple is about the design not the efficiency nor intelligence
2244,Apples two greatest periods where when Steve Jobs was at the helm.
2245,"Your showing ios 26 thats not even ready yet, obviously this isnt final version"
2246,"Research In Motion strikes back from the grave, Blackberry is really about to get the last laugh."
2247,Rare? I wouldn't call it that.
2248,"the Glass is a bit much, the designers locked in a room for far to long over explaining it, hoity-toity"
2249,Appleâ€™s AI teams are starting to sound like the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army
2250,Welcome back Internet Explorer
2251,ai is gonna crash hard and apple will look brilliant for not having it integrated
2252,"Why is this such a surprise? Apple's specialty is making phones, not training AI. They lack the domain expertise to develop AI.
And their CEO is a bean counter, not a product developer."
2253,AI is forced bullshit
2254,Using an iPhone is a downgrade.
2255,Massive fail
2256,"It's not that Apple is inherently failing, but that LLM technology is inherently flawed."
2257,ðŸ¤£
2258,"There are certain things about this video, that are incorrect. Firstly, other than certain specific features like on screen, awareness, and personal context, other features of Apple Intelligence like image playground, Genmoji, writing tools, ChatGPT integration, and other such features have been released and users are using it. Itâ€™s possible that some users may not like the features, but the features are out there. So it is not the case that Apple Intelligence has not been launched at all. Certain specific features of Apple Intelligence have been delayed because Apple would rather publish a product which serves its purpose, rather than publish something that makes users even more dissatisfied. Secondly, in WWDC 2025, Apple has never said that the remaining features of Apple Intelligence like on screen awareness and personal context are coming this fall. Do not spread misinformation.
Thirdly, Apple, unlike open AI, Google, is not an AI company. Apple is not expected to launch another chat, bot, ChatGPT, or Gemini, or copilot. It is expected to integrate AI into its product experience in a way that makes the experience better. Another chat bot is not an expectation out of Apple. The degree of expectation from Apple is largely different, compared to what people have from Google. The video is informative, but definitely and undoubtedly, misleading."
2259,"18:47 bruh, who edited this?"
2260,"Elon has been selling full self driving ""available next year"" for nearly 10 years for Tesla."
2261,It's the downfall of Apple
2262,"Problem with all tech companies it seem is that they lack direction and a unified vision. As much as I dislike both Apple and Steve Jobs, having a single person with an actual vision direct things over a long period of time actually works. Getting new people in to work on this or that money making scheme then replacing them when they fail doesn't work. Google and it's graveyard products is a prime example of this, it could have been so much more than it is if it had stuck with and refined some of the products they axed and turned them into a cohesive ecosystem. Even YouTube, arguably one of their most valuable products are suffering from their failure to turn it into more than an ad funded video hosting service because of this. This is what happens when you're always catering to investors and as a result hire incompetent CEO's only to fire them and hire someone else equally incompetent after a few years. It's not even that they're necessarily bad CEO's, they might be good at whatever that means, but they're not the vision people. What is considered a good CEO in most circles have a vision and plan for money in investor pockets, not products in consumer pockets, not a grand vision for the future they want to see, a future that is marketable, because they don't have imagination. Remember, Steve Jobs was not a tech guy, he was primarily a designer, an art guy. If your company is not being run by a dreamer you're not going to dream up new cool stuff. And if you have a dreamer but only let them stay for a couple of years because they weren't immediately profitable, you just end up like Google, fractured and scattered all over the place with no direction. It's the same issue you see with a lot of democratic counties. Someone comes in, tries to do a bunch of good stuff, few years later someone else comes in a think that stuff sucks and ends it all in favour of a bunch of other also good stuff, then again and again, so nothing gets to mature and there is no unified vision or direction or prolonged effort. Not that I'm against democracy, but it a highly inefficient and slow way to make progress that often takes one step forward and two back and even on it's best days take two steps forward and one back. But when it comes to running a civilization slow and steady might yet win the race. The same is not true in the setting of a corporation, you can't do that there unless you want to get left behind and inevitably replaced by someone that does have a vision. Essentially the main problem is when the goal becomes profit, rather than profit being a side effect of someone reaching for a greater vision, a unified and coherent long term plan to great something great for the sake of it. If your imagination only extends to ""I think people will buy this"" you're doing it wrong, it needs to be ""I think this will make the world a better place""."
2263,Iâ€™m not that big of a fan of the first minute of this video. Showing screenshots from a development beta where itâ€™s expected to be riddled with bugs and far from finished to get your point across leaves a sour taste. That being said Apple AI was and still is a desaster - especially it being one of main selling points for the iPhone 16 last year and then underdelivering in every aspect possible.
2264,Rotting Apple? ðŸ
2265,"It's ok , we don't need AI everywhere"
2266,"I hope this isn't a paid promotion for Gemini, because I use that for a couple weeks and switch back to chat gbt because while it's not integrated, it's smarter"
2267,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say Apple saw that it was a bubble, waited for it to pop and be able to say ""yeah we figured that from the start"". There's a reason there's no WEB3 blockchain garbage in your iPhone. Moreover, most people just don't want AI in all of their shit and they likely know it. It's mostly investors that are making this huge push."
2268,It's a mess. What they need is Tim Cook intervening and overseeing it properly - integrate the features already in AI - the software and the technology - you simply have to integrate - ITS NOT THAT HARD - improve Siri to make it like ChatGPT chat bot and voice chat- It already exists - modify it to be more apple like - and there you have it - the technology already exists - how can it be so hard?
2269,"Talk about a ""bump"" in the road: Jobs would not (and I do not either) accept the bloody bulge of a camera on the iphone! It is a serious ugliness that was always not Apple. Now it is. Crap!"
2270,"""Siri, fail gracefully""

2275,"Steve Jobs was a huge asshole but yeah none of this would fly under his leadership. Tim Cook isnâ€™t a creative, heâ€™s a numbers and logistics guy. Once Steve died innovation died and the new products that came out were things that were most likely technology that was being worked on while Steve was alive. People need to remember that new technology takes a decade or more to be created more times than not."
2276,TLDR: mkbhd is a corpo shill and apple intelligence is a scam
2277,"I dont use apple, so i wasnt aware  they had this issue, and I was planning to buy my dad a brand new iphone for christmas since the current one wasnt compatible with their AI features, good to know!"
2278,"Wokness is starting to hit Apple hard, very hard. When the sexual preference of people is more of important than your own business, this happens."
2279,Tell them to dig a hole and not giving them a shovel
2280,Does this matter though? it doesn't because Apple isn't a tech company anymore. It's a fashion brand.  It thrives off of the public perception of Apple products = rich. That's where they won ground over android. Android can be the best thing since sliced bread but it doesn't have the image that apple gives off.
2281,AI hype took a big bite out of the Apple
2282,Apple's approach to Data Privacy and Security is why Apple will never be at the top of AI race. it simply has no data.
2283,"Intrigues between apple teams developing basically the same product? Sounds like Lisa and Macintosh all over again... Only this time, none of it seems to work"
2284,"I heard it's like an internal company people problem they got with their AI, also AI is still at it's infancy. I'm seeing news that about how much lawsuits there are against AI developers. them big companies really are getting mad that their IP is being used to train AI image generation"
2285,"This is what happens when you let a man with no vision take over from a man who was a visionary. Steve Jobs wasn't the genius they all credited him to be, but he was definitely a visionary for Apple. This new guy, Tim Apple LOL, he sucks. He is guaranteed that apple is going back down the path it was on before jobs returned."
2286,"I never thought I would, but since it was turned on in my phone I've been using Gemini a lot. I was blown away by the fact that it could even play a whole board game with me by describing it's moves for me to physically manipulate on the board."
2287,No one from Apple is even qualified to talk about AI or intelligence in general. These people have been failing at everything they do (except the M-series chips) for at least a decade now.
2288,"""apple"" intelligence is a very fitting name for this disaster. And this whole situation is very reminiscent of Apple's dark days in the mid 1990s."
2289,Apple as a tech company has died if you are living under a rock now it is a lifestyle and finance company.
2290,Unnovation time
2291,Apple might be the next Nokia and Blackberry
2292,Stop every thing! Spaceballs 2 was just announced. The quest for more money.
2293,Who buys phone for AI? Who buys phone for camera? Phone lost its true purpose.
2294,"I can understand why a subset of the consumer base is upset over Apple Intelligence, but most of us couldnâ€™t care any less about it. AI is not something we ever really wanted. All we want is Siri to be slightly more useful."
2295,"I can understand why a subset of the consumer base is upset over Apple Intelligence, but most of us couldnâ€™t care any less about it. AI is not something we ever really wanted. All we want is Siri to be slightly more useful."
2296,I've never seen any of these bugs not even in beta versions of IOS
2297,"Apple has become the Nokia of the Smartphone Industry, They need that Classic Apple Magic again. 3 Trillion should be more than enough to start building something Great."
2298,"Incompetence fulled by ""trust fund"" syndrome. No one at apple, other than the Silicon team, is compentent, and in position of leadership due to merit and execution. Apple TV+ losses $1B a year but there's a new F1 movie out with Brad pit? WTF? Why is apple producing movies and TV? It's ego that is funded by the legacy of Jobs/Ivy. 

The board and Tim cook should be removed with a shareholder movement (I'm a smaller shareholder)"
2299,Current Apple is what happens when you put more money and focus on the marketing team instead of tech & innovation.
2300,Timâ€™s cooked
2301,"Apple is the only one treating AI responsibly. There is no disaster, just another tech bubble that everyone is riding that they will promptly pretend they weren't riding when it finally fails spectacularly."
2302,no wonder apple is now only doing virtual announcement instead of live
2303,"Apple sucks ass, fans have just convinced themselves it's a status symbol"
2304,Google and chatgpt should offer white label AI services.....Apple can the put their lable as Apple Intelligence just like Copilot did
2305,"I have only used assistant for meetings and alarms, anything else, is 100% (real) AI for me"
2306,@coldFusion if you hate apple so much now why do you still use them to make your videos lol
2307,@coldFusion if you hate apple so much now why do you still use them to make your videos lol
2308,Apple is more busy making itâ€™s logo rainbow again than AI development ðŸ‘€
2309,"Yeah, Siri has gotten worse and worse"
2310,"Apple's problem on this one is they were late to the party, and because of the advancement speed of AI as a technology, by the time they noticed they were too far behind to play catch up from 0, so they partnered with another company (Open AI) and rushed the tech to market so that they wouldn't get left any further behind, but this is the opposite of what they normally do. Apple is one of the only technology companies that don't release MVP's to the public, and almost everything Apple is closed source, meaning they maintain control over not only ownership, but quality assurance too. The truth is the part they did, plugging OpenAI into their system works flawlessly, but the integration is only as good as the data going in, and in this case as we know, AI has some awkward and clunky aspects, such as misinterpreting tone and hallucinating."
2311,"They have trillion dollar in their pockets but they don't want to steal ai engineers from Google or open ai by offering them attractive salary package, that's weird, from when corporates start follow morals?"
2312,"I would never ever buy any apple product , it is outdated and always problematic"
2313,Whatever happens don't wear battery on your eyes.
2314,Apple intelligence works perfectly on my phone with Apple Intelligence. I donâ€™t know what you haters are talking about.
2315,So their are going Vista with their new design?
2316,The original Siri was amazing. Now it's just a talking web search. Why the change?
2317,Apple may be right about AI not being truly intelligent but that doesnâ€™t excuse them from having the worst AI product in their lineup.

2324,"The joke is. I am running iOS26 dev beta. It is terrible! I am not talking about the many bugs, terribly high battery usage, heating up my phone or the many crashes and apps not working. Those are bugs hopefully fixed in future beta's. I am talking about Liquid Glass. It is TERRIBLE. It looks very strange and ugly. I wish I never updated to iOS26. I can't wait to move to an android phone again after this. The design does not fit anything on the phone. Notifications look weird and half the time things are unreadable. I am 34 and I have perfect eye sight. Still things just don't blend well at many times and if you look at side by sides between iOS 18 and iOS 26 many would have thought iOS 18 was the upgrade."
2325,I genuinely believe that they used Covid as a scapegoat to get out of doing live demos and hands on. And as a result they figured they can just fake everything and here we are now.
2326,"Showing beta iOS 26 is crazy, they will fix that, full version only coming out in September lol"
2327,Absolutely not sam altman and his team. It was ilya mostly and sa shouldve been ousted right then and there.
2328,"I much prefer Siri over gemini live. If I wanted a chatbot I would download an app. I want an assistant to check weather, send messages, pause or play my stuff, and get stuff done, not give me AI slop. I disabled all Apple Intelligence features too.

I dont need AI to write to my family (I actually love them), I don't need AI to send my email. This is thing my brain does because I still have one. If you dont use it you loose it. These AI features are only for investors. I actually like apple's approach more than Googles who went all in on it."
2329,Part of Apple's identity is a tightly controlled product design and user experience. Generative AI conflicts with that due to its probabilistic nature.
2330,iOS 18 was only ugly because they saved all the good stuff for iOS 26. This video will become outdated very soon.
2331,"â€œTurned up late, and borrowed someone elseâ€™s tools. Not very apple like â€œ ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ thatâ€™s all Apple does, â€œborrowsâ€ or truthfully steals other companies tools and software,"
2332,"AI Should be trained using real humans, not databases."
2333,What are you saying? they spent full 1 year to create a theme 
2334,This is what happens when technology matures and growth comes from the marketing department not engineering.
2335,Itâ€™s the beginning of an end.
2336,I want to see fall of apple and nintendo ðŸ˜‰
2337,"Apple is so lazy usually that it waits for others to do most of the work. Then it comes later like it invented that feature. But AI isn't like that, Apple did it's usual and fell on it's face flat."
2338,Couldn't have happened to a better company...
2339,At least they were men enough to admit it this time respect Apple
2340,Wow
2341,"I was around for the release of the original Siri and followed the news around the Siri team ever since, the moment I heard about Apple Intelligence I knew it was going to be a mess and I absolutely knew Siri wouldnâ€™t be able to access apps.

2352,"My question is why are these tech influencers creating a big buzz over ai? What the literal fuck does it do? Who's using ai everyday now? People are still with their frigging 11 and 13 as far as I know. Even a 100 dollar android phone or 8 yr old iphone can run chatgpt, gemini or perplexity. What more do any of us want?"
2353,The only thing worse than Apple's non-existent AI model is their pride in the entire matter...completely acting like there's no problem at all WWDC25 is amazing.

It seems that this is the way Tech Billionaires are going these days, they make big and brash claims on features they cannot deliver on, the gullible target market then buys their substandard products expecting the new features and then they get buyers remorse as they discover they have been conned all along...

Those that buy technology at the bleeding edge just to be one up on the Joneses deserve to be ripped off, they have the same low intelligence of the fashion victim who are always looking for the latest fad to follow..."

My goal is not to critique or hurt you Mr. Coldfusion, but something nowadays is missing from the time I began following your videos.

The mystery of learning something either hidden, novel or emerging... I find your videos now lag behind what I already learn or know. Or even the populus sometimes.

I am tremendously grateful to have been following you for so long. So much fantastic content I have watched from you. You were the spur of some of my beliefs and interesting knowledge topics. You made me research and learn. you posted a video, i watched sameday. Now, it's a different story.

All the best, I hope things go great for you!"

2361,"""what actually went wrong behind the scenes?""
Jobs died obviously"
2362,Apple is like a politician now just deflection from their huge failures with shiny crap like emojis and a made up word for a blurry screen icon display...The iphone has not changed materially since the 12 just a few tweaks and huge focus on a tiny bit of titanium in the frame.

2372,"I left Apple years ago, but had a couple of 2014 computers collecting dust, couldn't update anymore and they barely worked. I installed Linux on a Mac Mini and a MacBook Air and they work better than new. The hardware is still good, but the software forced failure. That is actually evil. I doubt the walled garden strategy will win in the end."
2373,Steve Jobs' passing was the beginning of the end for Apple. Sure they've made a lot of money since losing him but that was entirely just running on momentum built by Jobs. The soul has gone completely out of their products. They're just another disconnected tech giant now.

This video has clips from the interview Apple did earlier the week where Craig says AI features showed last year were not vaporware and were working models yet you donâ€™t include it in the video and still called it vapoware based on what? Also most of the AI features announced last year did materialize, only Siri didnâ€™t. This is all hyperbole and I expected better from ColdFusion. Do I need to sue to get you make video about yourself?"

2397,One of the most anti-consumer companies finally getting what it deserves.
2398,"Apple has sadly falled behind in core technologies as AI was never Apples forte (Also in software features with they are now copying from droid so its otherway round then decade ago ). Google Gemini (Thanks to google assistance tech. which already had speech to text , speech to search data & emotional speech data  )  & Galaxy AI are far ahead & the gap will only increase. Remeber even Bixby is better then Siri thats shows even bigger issue , google also was in google lens (predating circle to search ) etc so Google was already a semi AI company they just had to slightly adjust there settings whereas Apple has to do from Scatch at this rate it will take 3 - 5 years to just match todays gemini , i can also see error in the text to call facility like one user said to siri please ask mom to call this week which siri intepreted as Dont call me , & samsung is seamlessly attached to Google Gemini & its own Galaxy AI , making it years ahead of Apple."

Lack of vision and investing into the future. Making wall street happy was what they were doing. Well now Wall Street is not happy with what Apple is doing or not doing. So, it's a catch-22 situation for Apple."

We just got tired of them. We just dropped them and we went to another Samsung galaxy ultra galaxy it works better. Take long time to get used but itâ€™s OK at least you can rely on the product.

Then, the ""underdog"" got it's second wind, but unfortunately (paradoxically) it has become the monster by becoming the monster it was attacked by (give Neitzche a read). I am so not interested in them anymore. They deserve to go away now. $1T business isn't interested in its core values: its intersted in its domination. FOFF Apple!"

On the other hand Apple has really flopped on AI and its an absolute Joke. They really messed up on this one and its going to have colossal consequences. If i were to guess what caused this, they were concentrating to much on Apple Glasses, if you look back at the past few years thats always been the Hype..Rather then Take AI seriously., Fall will show nothing they will forever be behind now."

2481,Apple gl(ass) is definetly a smokescreen to detract from the lack of big new features.
2482,overripen is so suitable for apple
2483,"I mean, I can't refute the facts - and it makes sense that Apple's executives would fracture without the cult of personality that was Jobs. Perhaps this part of Siri's ""failure"" will be a life lesson. If Federighi ends up salvaging Apple Intelligence, that will likely just fall under his purview going forward.
I still maintain that Apple doesn't want to do what everyone else is doing (aside from what we saw with the Google AI segment, that's exactly part of what Apple is going for). I believe Apple is looking to make JARVIS, not a replacement for a person. Originally, I expected Siri to just *be* JARVIS. But I think the Siri brand has been so damaged that the plan now is to effectively ""dismantle"" Siri and implement the AI as a low level component within the OS, with Siri itself simply being a verbal element. I believe this is why we saw so much of Apple's keynote demonstrating the tight integration of targeted AI within apps.
For instance, I think we'll see Photos get the ability to use AI to devise dates images were taken based on the content of the photo - a great feature for families digitizing their great-grandmothers' photo albums. Or, the Health app collating health data with their fitness catalog to make even more targeted information. Couple that with (hopefully) Apple being able to get real-time glucose measurements out Apple Watch, and we could be looking at Apple letting the user know if they have the Dawn Effect and recommending a workout to help offset that early morning glucose spike. Or being able to collate sleep data with weight and heart data (instead of having dozens of individual metrics) - a ""hey, you lost 5 lbs, and in that time we noticed fewer sleep events, and your glucose remained in reasonable levels"" kind of thing.
This goes back to Jobs. There is no one at Apple who is the ""voice of the consumer"" the way Jobs was. No one to look at something and say ""what is the use case."" There is an infamous story about Jobs watching the Mac fire up for the first time, and the first thing he did was criticize the team for how the Mac took too long to start up -- that a customer shouldn't have to wait that long. no one at Apple is THAT person. It's a whole bunch of executives waiting for the marching orders that are not coming, especially since Tim Cook is an operations guy.
Forestall wanted to be THAT guy, but was a pain in the ass, forgetting you don't get to ACT like Steve Job at his worst until you can deliver the way Steve Jobs could. And perhaps maybe acting like Steve Jobs was something that should have just been left with Steve Jobs.
Cook needs to get his executives into a room, and pick one of the old guard - Federighi or Cue - to basically be the ""voice of the consumer"" and get the various teams focused and coordinated. This whole everyone is siloed thing is absurd when you have so many moving parts that need to all march on the same foot at the same time."
2484,it all started when apple ditched iphone mini
2485,Failure over and over. Apple are woke gender activists more obsessed with themselves than reality.
2486,"I am kind of in the camp that these internal apple people were ultimately right about AI being overvalued and not interesting. Their own internal research kind of proved that at the very least LLMs don't actually think. In my view the main issue here is the lack of confidence to either go all in on something or completely bet against it. They should have bet against traditional VR and gone all in on AR, but they didn't. They made another VR headset and failed. They should have bet against chatbots and focused purely on practical applications that work, but they didn't and they failed. I don't believe the AI hype, I think most of it is vaporware, but the others just do a better job of hiding it."
2487,Apples AI paper is also dogshit
2488,I do think that the idea of running smaller light-weight GPTs (for specialized tasks) locally on-device that are more secure is a really good idea that I am glad Apple is pursuing.

2498,"Wow, this is so weird. In my life, and on all the devices I have and have had, I have never encountered a single bug or anything wrong with the Apple software. This is weird to see people having these problems.

EDIT: Oh, F me, are you serious? IF YOU INSTALL A BETA VERSION, IT IS OBVIOUS YOU GET BUGS, IT IS LITERALLY CALLED BETA"
2499,A rare failure? Apple has been taking Ls for years. They're a shell of what they used to be
2500,"Apart from the overpromising I don't see too much fault on Apples side.
Its true, they got a cold start due to internal troubles and indeed they play catchup in the generative AI base technology.

However the vision by Apple is not the technology, but what it enables. And this vision of a private, preferably local, fully-interconnected AI system with context of your private information has not been achived by anyone. Especially the private/local aspect.

Googles implementation of personal context heavily relies on the cloud, nothing local or private there.
All GenAI ChatBots (especially the good ones) heavily rely on the cloud as well. Except for Gemini none have access to personal context.

Additionally its not like gmail users or iPhone users were excluded from the advances in GenAI. Anyone could install Gemini, ChatGPT etc.

2527,"It is the accumulation of a company that builds very high walls to wall off a garden, stealing features from others, can't truly innovate, and rapes developers of 30% of their hard-earned funds, yet never offers 30% worth of updates. Their twice-a-year, Hollywood-polished videos are so predictable now that you don't even have to watch them to know precisely what they will say. They will have great zoom in introduction camera gimbles, someone will be standing on the roof and center garden of the campus building, someone will be on a hill overlooking the bay area, and they will talk about how much better this phones version of the camera is, how much faster apple silicon is and several new features they stole from Android OS or Samsung phones, while passing it off like it's theirs and that they are doing us a favor. Apple is a company filled with marketing genius, but light on outstanding engineers. It also appears their management is no longer top-notch.

2603,"Pretty similar to how Intel became complacent and stopped innovating, allowing the rest of the market to catch up and surpass them."
2604,"when you are the leader of sophisticated technology and arguably most desired company for consumer tech, any flaw or vulnerability will be enough to cause a big blast. LLMs are surely helpful, but does Samsung has one? nope. then why are people not targeting Samsung? simply because they're not the leaders, unlike Apple. Now with GPT and Google, GPT had the potential to dethrone google in terms of internet search, hence Google panicked and delivered Gemini, is anyone talking about tensor chips in their pixel phone? - nope. Then why Apple, because everyone scrutinizes apple and when there is a small flaw, it'll explode like anything. Now, the writing tools feature is pretty good,  I use it on my Mac, sure its not too advanced but it helps, its not a necessity, moreover Apple is working on it to provide a better one next year, so there's that too and meanwhile I can use GPT. They have a dedicated App for GPT on Mac unlike any other LLM. 

Whatever it be, I think apple has delivered but not like what it used to, we had gotten used to its groundbreaking tech, but this time it was mediocre, which is also good, but not best. So I think we should not just get our hands dirty by involving in reckless Apple AI shaming without a proper analysis."

Phone, Tab, Laptop, Watch, Earphone, Headphone, Rings, Cards, Wallets they have tried everything humans can perceive in their day to life and everything has peaked. Only vision pro has actually innovation left but adoption will be niche since its not a necessary utility. Now they will have to go back to cars or robots like tesla.

LLMs need huge infrastructure, power, and constant cloud access. Appleâ€™s more about sustainability, user privacy, and stuff that fits their ecosystem. Their research shows theyâ€™re working on smaller models and smarter systems, not just chatbot hype. Would be cool to see a follow-up that dives into that side of the story."

Their goal isnâ€™t to chase giant cloud models but to build something closer to real AGI, private, efficient, and able to run on-device.

2707,The reason why is those other products were pioneered by a true visionary in Steve Jobs. Tim Cook isn't that type of CEO that has that vision that Steve Jobs had. Not only that but Apple being a privacy oriented company makes it harder to develop a good AI model as that requires a lot of data to train and they're too stuck up to train an off the shelf model that may produce much better results than doing it from scratch.

It bred in the attitude that your customers are now your serfs who will buy anything you put out.
The decay started a long time ago and Apple stopped trying to innovate and fell into the Hollywood trap of endless rehashes and reruns of existing products.
Now they have a stagnant corporate culture just like what happened to IBM in the 1980s, IBM was the tech darling of the 1960s but started to stagnate in the 70s and by the 1980s they were what I term a tech zombie, aimlessly following the trends and not setting them any longer."

Both Microsoft and Google have already renamed their AI, because of how it was launched kind of haphazardly, but Apple can't do this.
